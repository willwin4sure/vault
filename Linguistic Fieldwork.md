Usually, you present example sentences in three lines:

**X!oo kuulduud bii**
X!oo linguist     is
"X!oo is a linguist"

The middle line consists of ==gloss==, a word-for-word translation of the foreign text.

In general, the idea is to collate a bunch of these example sentences in order to infer what various constructions mean, and what the patterns are.

* Make sure your consultant knows what you're interested in: "how people really speak", not "proper language".
* Start with simple, culturally appropriate sentences.
* Don't assume that you're getting what you're asking for.
* Be organized.
* Be nice!
