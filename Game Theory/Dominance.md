Consider some player $i \in N$ and a [[Representation of Games#Normal-Form Representation|normal form game]] $G=(N,S_{1},\dots,S_{n},u_{1},\dots,u_{n})$. We implicitly assume that players form beliefs $\beta_{-i}$ about other players' strategies and play strategies that maximize expected utility under that belief, in which case we call the player ==rational==.

A strategy is called ==strictly dominant== if it strictly dominates all other strategies; it is ==weakly dominant== if it weakly dominates all other strategies, but at least one domination is strict.

> [!definition]
> A strategy profile $s^{*}=(s_{1}^{*},\dots,s_{n}^{*})$ is said to be a ==dominant-strategy equilibrium== if $s_{i}^{*}$ is weakly dominant for all $i$.
