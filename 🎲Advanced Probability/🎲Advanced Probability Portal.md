From the second half of the MIT graduate course [18.675 Theory of Probability](http://student.mit.edu/catalog/search.cgi?search=18.675) taught by Konstantinos Kavvadias. For the first half of the course, check out the [[📏Measures and Probability Portal]]. Some of this material also overlaps with the sequel course, which you can find here: [[🚶Stochastic Calculus Portal]].

This section of the course follows James Norris' set of notes [Advanced Probability](https://www.statslab.cam.ac.uk/~james/Lectures/ap.pdf).
