This you probably already know from studying for quant interviews, e.g. the [Kelly criterion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelly_criterion) and the ["just one more" paradox](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FuuYSM7yOo).

## Wealth Utility Functions

When we discussed [[Utility and Budget#^15a1a4|utility functions]], we expressed utils as a function of the bundle of goods you buy. It is often useful to simplify this into a utility as a function of your total wealth, instead.

> To decide whether or not to take a risk, see if the expected change in utility is positive, not just expected change in wealth.

By  [[Utility and Budget#^937ed8|diminishing marginal utility]], we generally assume that this utility function is concave: this corresponds to how people are risk-averse. For example, $\mathcal{U}(W)=\log W$ is a common function, as well as $\mathcal{U}(W)=-e^{-W}$.

Note that the richer you are, the more linear your utility generally looks: Elon Musk is much more willing to take a million dollar flip with substantial edge than you are (the downside of losing a million dollars is a lot worse for the person with less wealth). 

I could put some example problems here but they're straightforward.
## The Lottery

Why do people even play the lottery then? Some possibilities:

1. People are actually risk-loving (convex utility). This is a bit inconsistent, since people do things like buy insurance. There's a lot of evidence that people are really risk-averse.
2. People are alternatively risk-averse and risk-loving. Maybe they're actually willing to take a risk if it could change their lives, but not for small amounts.
3. Gambling is entertaining. They are paying for the fun!
4. People are misinformed and don't know what they're doing. Maybe the government should actually be discouraging this activity!
