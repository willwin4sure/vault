This gives us a way of modeling why people purchase insurance! However, there's one great issue that faces insurance providers: <span style="color:#0088ff">adverse selection</span> and <span style="color:#0088ff">information asymmetry</span>. Individuals know more about how risky their own life is than the insurance company, so the company is at risk of only selling losing deals!

## An Example

Suppose there are 100 people in the population, 90 of which are healthy and 10 of which are sick. 

The healthy people have a 10% chance of incurring $\$10,000$ and 90% of incurring $\$0$, while the sick people have a 50% chance of incurring $\$10,000$ and 50% of incurring $\$0$. What's a fair price for insurance assuming everyone buys? Well, the average cost is $0.9\cdot \$1000+0.1\cdot \$5000=\$1400$. 

So if we sell insurance for $\$1500$ we can make a profit. Unfortunately, this is an amazing deal for the sick people (unless they are extremely risk-loving) and not great for the healthy people (unless they are rather risk-averse). 

Alright, what if only half the healthy people buy? Your revenues would be $\$82,500$ while your expected payout is $\$90,000$: you need to raise prices. But this just causes less healthy people to buy! And so on...

## What Gives?

There are five possible outcomes. Sadly, 2–5 are all market failures.

1. **Market Success**

This happens if the healthy people are risk averse enough to buy insurance anyway. This is somewhat unlikely.

2. **Market Collapse**

The insurance company can't make money, so it just shuts down.

3. **Only sell to the sick at a price above $\$5000$
4. **Only sell to the healthy by discriminating**

Deny health insurance to anyone who looks sick or has pre-existing conditions.

5. **Sell different products**

Get people to reveal their health; sick people could buy a free care plan at a high price, while healthy people could buy a high deductible plan at a low price.

## Government Intervention

Perhaps the government can save the day.

1. **Could subsidize the purchase of health insurance

Say the government paid everyone $\$500$ if they buy health insurance. Then the healthy people are also in. This happens for purchases of insurance through work (it is not taxed, leading to a $250 billion/year tax subsidy).

2. **Could mandate the purchase of health insurance**

The insurance company profits since everyone has to buy. But the healthy people are annoyed! It's a lot easier to pay them off than to mandate them.

3. **Could directly provide the insurance**

This is the traditional social insurance model in the U.S.

## The Social Insurance Tradeoff

Unfortunately, providing insurance leads to a different problem, called <span style="color:#0088ff">moral hazard</span>. If you buy fire insurance on your home, maybe you are less likely to keep fire extinguishers around.

A massive example of this problem is with workers' compensation insurance, where it is difficult to distinguish between real and false claims, and the upside of making a false claim is quite large (can stay at home and still be compensated a majority of lost wages).

Essentially, the marginal benefit of leisure has increased, so the marginal benefit of work must be larger to compensate. This leads to larger wages, and fewer products: we get a less efficient economy!

## Social Security

This is the biggest single program in the U.S., which provides insurance against earnings loss due to retirement or disability. It is an $800 billion/year program. (Up close in second is Medicare, which provides universal coverage for elderly.)

When you retire or become disabled, you will get a check from Social Security. This is an increasing function of your pre-retirement earnings, but it is <span style="color:#0088ff">progressive</span>: the more you earn, the lower percentage it replaces. You continually receive this check until you die: it is an <span style="color:#0088ff">annuity payment</span>. 

This is a form of insurance against longevity. You don't know how long you'll live after retirement, and it is possible that you'll save too little. There is evidence that this program has been powerful in reducing poverty among the elderly.

Unfortunately, it also leads to increased retirement (removing producing older workers and causing higher tax burden). This is not such a problem in the U.S., but it is terrible in Europe.

In the Netherlands, you can retire at 55 with a SS benefit of 90% of your pre-retirement wage. This is an <span style="color:#0088ff">implicit tax</span> of 90% on working: the opportunity cost of leisure is only 10% of your initial wage! Yet to fund this program, your income is already taxed at 40%! So you lose money by working... of course then, nobody works!

The U.S. solves this problem by <span style="color:#0088ff">actuarial adjustment</span>: for every year past 62 that you work, your benefits post-retirement go up by 6.7%.
