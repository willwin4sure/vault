[[Factor Demand|Last time]], we saw how firms decide how much to pay in order to get a certain amount of labor. In this section, we answer the supply side of the question: how much are people willing to work given a certain wage?

## Deriving Labor Supply

We can model this just as in [[Utility and Budget]]. We will consider a tradeoff between two positives: <span style="color:#0088ff">consumption</span> and <span style="color:#0088ff">leisure</span> (time spent not working).

What is the budget constraint? Well, if someone takes $\ell$ hours of leisure, then they work $24-\ell$ hours at a wage of $w$. This allows $c=(24-\ell)w$ consumption (we normalize the <span style="color:#0088ff">price of consumption</span> $p$ to $1$).

We can rewrite this as
$$
c+w\ell=24w.
$$
In other words, the "price of leisure" is the wage rate $w$, as that is the opportunity cost of not making money.

Now, I give you a utility function $\mathcal{U}(c,\ell)$ then ask you to solve for your optimal bundle $(c^{*},\ell ^{*})$. This tells me the amount you are willing to work $24-\ell ^{*}$ given a certain wage $w$.

Now, we have both the supply and demand side of labor markets, which will result in an equilibrium!

## Monopsony

This is what happens when only a single firm supplies labor. Similar to [[ðŸ“ˆMicroeconomics 1/Monopoly and Oligopoly/Monopoly|monopolies]], but this time the demand side is manipulated, not the supply side. Labor and wages will be artificially lowered (along the given supply curve) in order to optimize for profits: the <span style="color:#0088ff">marginal expenditure</span> on labor is now 
$$
\frac{d}{dL}(L\cdot w(L))=w+\frac{dw}{dL}\cdot L,
$$
which is greater than just $w$; this instead is now set to $MRP_{L}$. Mathematical details are left as an exercise.
