When would two countries decide to trade? The answer is when it allows both countries to expand the possible set of goods their citizens have access to.

## Production Possibilities Frontier

Once again, we simply to the case of two goods. Here's a picture of potential PPFs for a student in a class.

> [!definition] Definition (Economies of scope)
> The PPF can have different shapes. If it is convex, we call it an <span style="color:#0088ff">economy of scope</span>; otherwise, we call it a <span style="color:#0088ff">diseconomy of scope</span>. 
## Comparative Advantage

Simply again; now, there are only two countries: Colombia and the United States. They are considering trading roses and computers. 

Suppose producing the goods only requires labor, and the following table gives the hours required for each country to produce each good:

|  | **Colombia** | **United States** |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| one carton of **roses** | 1 | 2 |
| one **computer** | 8 | 3 |

How do we decide whether or not to trade? We need to look at the [[⛺Supply and Demand Homepage#^457859|opportunity costs]] for each country to produce a good. Why? You are assigning the global labor supply more efficiently: if the US wants roses and Colombia wants computers, it's better to trade for them.

> [!definition] Definition (Comparative advantage)
> A country has a <span style="color:#0088ff">comparative advantage</span> in producing a good if the opportunity cost of producing it is lower.

In particular, Colombia has a comparative advantage in roses since $\frac{1}{8}< \frac{2}{3}$, while the United States has a comparative advantage in computers since $\frac{3}{2}<8$.

> [!definition] Definition (Absolute advantage)
> A country has an <span style="color:#0088ff">absolute advantage</span> in producing a good if it requires less labor to produce it.

> [!idea]
> Comparative advantage is what you care about when deciding whether or not to trade, not absolute advantage!

> [!explanation]-
> If Colombia took 3 units of labor to make a carton of roses instead, it would still have a competitive advantage in roses and a competitive disadvantage in computers, and trade should still occur. This happens despite the fact that the United States has absolute advantage in both goods.

> [!question]
> Tell me the range of ratios of roses for computers at which Colombia and the United States would be willing to trade.

> [!proof]- Check your answer
> $\left( \frac{3}{2},8 \right)$.
## Expansion of PPFs

Suppose the going rate is 4 roses for a computer. Then, the consumption sets of both Colombia and the US expand:

![[consumption_sets_under_trade.png|center|512]]

For example, in Colombia (on the left), instead of having to trade off 8 roses to make a computer, they can instead just produce 4 roses and trade them for a computer.

Another construct is the <span style="color:#0088ff">joint PPF</span>, which is just the PPF of both countries in aggregate:

![[joint_ppf.png|center|384]]

Notice how this leads to a world economy of scope. Further, trade encourages *specialization*: in the general case, the US should be producing computers and Colombia should be producing roses. Only if the world has a really high demand for roses (say) should the US start transitioning towards roses as well.

## How Does Comparative Advantage Arise?

Two main sources:

1. Differences in <span style="color:#0088ff">factor endowments</span>, e.g. Canada is a major exporter of lumber and paper products since the country just has a lot of forests; China is a major exporter of clothing since producing clothing is labor-intensive and China has a lot of labor!
2. Differences in <span style="color:#0088ff">technology</span>, e.g. Japan is a major exporter of automobiles despite no natural factor endowment advantage—they were just a leading developer of modern automobile technology.
