> If you can generate the entire project using O3 and it works, please do so. And you'll get your 75% of the grade.

> One of the worst things you can say while building compilers is "it's complicated but I'm smart". Because it's usually more complicated than you are smart.

> If you give me the code in a program but not its data structures, it is hard to understand. But give me the data structures and I can even infer what the code should do!

> All art is about one of three things: love, search of self, and revenge. You guys are the perfect age for the first two. Revenge, you're too young for that.

> Coming to MIT is all about learning to do hard things that other people cannot. Building a compiler is one of those hard things.

> LLMs produce superficially good code, but you need to learn how to fix their outputs. Much like graduate students.

> When you're standing outside you could be hit by an asteroid. What does this tell you about the precarity of life? This tells you that being alive is dangerous. The best way to deal with the "what if I get hit by an asteroid" problem is to just not think about it.

> How sad will you be? Sad enough.

> Who here wants to have a good life? Everyone here would like to make decisions that let you have a good life. One of the best decisions for a good life is making a good data representation for your compiler.

> You have to know what's important about each slide. The important thing about this slide is that these types of problems are easy to manufacture for the exam.

> There is an optimal amount of novelty in any design.

> When you see something wrong in the world, what should you do? Fix it! Make the world a better place.

> Ha! Ha! Ha! You made a mistake, no graduation for you.

> You should go off and write your thesis on why you shouldn't use a parser generator to parse a complicated language.
