In this section, we prove the following two facts: the distribution of a random vector is determined by its characteristic function, and pointwise convergence of characteristic functions implies weak convergence.

> [!definition] Definition (Weak convergence)
> Let $\mu$ be a Borel probability measure on $\mathbb{R}^{d}$ and let $(\mu_{n}:n\in \mathbb{N})$ be a sequence of such measures. We say that $\mu_{n}$ ==converges weakly== to $\mu$ if $\mu_{n}(f)\to \mu(f)$ as $n\to \infty$ for all continuous bounded functions $f$ on $\mathbb{R}^{d}$.
> 
> For random variables, we say that $X_{n}$ ==converges weakly== to $X$ if $\mu_{X_{n}}$ converges weakly to $\mu_{X}$. They don't need to be defined on a common probability space.

[!theorem]
Let $X$ be a random variable in $\mathbb{R}^{d}$.
