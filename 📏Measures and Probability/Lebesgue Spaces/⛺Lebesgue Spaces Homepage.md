[[‚õ∫Norms and Inequalities Homepage|Last]], we learned about the $L^{p}$-norm as a way of measuring distance between two measurable functions. In this section, we investigate the structure of the Lebesgue spaces $L^{p}$.
## Main Sequence

First, learn about $L^{p}$ as a Banach space and, in particular, $L^{2}$ as a Hilbert space. This lets us define the notions of variance, covariance, and conditional expectation (which is equivalent to orthogonal projection in the Hilbert space).

1. [[Lp as a Banach Space]]
2. [[L2 as a Hilbert Space]]
3. [[Variance, Covariance, Conditional Expectation]]

Then, learn some facts about convergence in $L^{1}$. The main result is that convergence in $L^{1}$ is equivalent to convergence in probability, plus a condition called *uniform integrability*.

4. [[Bounded Convergence]]
5. [[Uniform Integrability]]
