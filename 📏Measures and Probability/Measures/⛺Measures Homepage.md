The fundamental object in measure theory is, naturally, the [[Measure Spaces#^dde3c4|measure]]. Measures are foundational to formalizing probability theory. Indeed, when trying to formally define even basic concepts from probability, such as the uniform distribution on $[0,1]$, we will encounter [[Vitali Construction|nontrivial challenges]], necessitating a field of study refining our definitions and intuition.

Measures themselves are independently applicable to other fields such as integration theory and quantum physics. In this first section of the class, we will investigate measures in isolation before restricting our attention to probability spaces.

## Main Sequence

First, learn the formal definition of the fundamental objects in measure theory. Also, a simple example of measure spaces.

1. [[Measure Spaces]]
2. [[Discrete Measure Theory]]

Next, construct more sophisticated measures, such over the real numbers. 

3. [[Carathéodory's Extension Theorem]]
4. [[Uniqueness of Extensions]]
5. [[Lebesgue Measure]]

Finally, begin a discussion of probability, including important lemmas on infinite sequences of events.
