In this section, we build the required theory to construct nontrivial measures. To do so, we will specify values of the prenatal measure on a smaller set of subsets, and then *extend* this to a fully fledged measure on the entire generated $\sigma$-algebra.

First, explore the following two pages for some necessary definitions:
1. [[Rings and Algebras]]
2. [[Set Functions]]
## Statement

>[!theorem] Theorem (CarathÃ©odory's Extension Theorem)
>Let $\mathcal{A}$ be a [[Rings and Algebras#^aed1d6|ring]] in $E$ and let $\mu:\mathcal{A}\to[0,\infty]$ be a countably additive [[Set Functions#^b94a95|set function]]. Then, $\mu$ extends to a measure on the $\sigma$-algebra generated by $\mathcal{A}$.

## Proof
