[[Carathéodory's Extension Theorem]] allows us to extend premeasures on rings to measures on $\sigma$-algebras. In this section, we will prove a useful theorem about when extensions are unique.

There is some prerequisite material.
1. [[Pi and Lambda Systems]]
2. [[Sierpiński–Dynkin's π-λ theorem]]

>[!theorem] Theorem (Uniqueness of Extensions)
>Suppose $\mu_{1},\mu_{2}$ are measures on $(E,\mathcal{E})$ with $\mu_{1}(E)=\mu_{2}(E)<\infty$. If $\mu_{1}$ and $\mu_{2}$ agree on some $\pi$-system $\mathcal{A}$ generating $\mathcal{E}$, then $\mu_{1}$ agrees with $\mu_{2}$ on $\mathcal{E}$.
