I didn't know where to place these definitions.

> [!definition] Definition (Finite measure)
> If $\mu(E)<\infty$, then we call $\mu$ a <span style="color:#0088ff">finite measure</span>.

> [!definition] Definition ($\sigma$-finite measure)
>  If there exists a countable sequence of sets $(E_{n}:n\in\mathbb{N})$ in $\mathcal{E}$ with $\mu(E_{n})<\infty$ for all $n$ and $\bigcup_{n}E_{n}=E$, then $\mu$ is a <span style="color:#0088ff">$\sigma$-finite measure</span>.
