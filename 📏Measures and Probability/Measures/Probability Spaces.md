It's about time to formalize the connection to probability.

> [!definition] Definition (Probability space)
> Take a [[Measure Spaces#^607777|measure space]] $(E,\mathcal{E},\mu)$. If $\mu(E)=1$ then $\mu$ is a <span style="color:#0088ff">probability measure</span> and $(E,\mathcal{E},\mu)$ is a <span style="color:#0088ff">probability space</span>, in which case we will usually use the notation $(\Omega,\mathcal{F},\mathbb{P})$.

You can interpret $(\Omega,\mathcal{F},\mathbb{P})$ as a model for *experiment involving chance*:

* $\Omega$ is the set of all possible outcomes, or worlds.
* $\mathcal{F}$ is the set of observable subsets of outcomes, or <span style="color:#0088ff">events</span>.
* $\mathbb{P}(A)$ is the probability of the events $A$ occurring.
