Reminiscent of the ergodic theorem from stochastic processes, ergodicity refers to the idea that in a dynamical system, a point will eventually visit all parts of the space in a uniform and random sense.

The theory we develop in this section will allow us to nuke the [[Strong Law of Large Numbers]].
