In this section, we consider sequences of i.i.d. random variables and what happens if we shift all their indices over by one. It turns out that this operation is ergodic and measure-preserving.

## Infinite Product Spaces

Let $m$ be a probability measure on $\mathbb{R}$. A long time ago, we used [[Rademacher Functions|Rademacher functions]] to construct a probability space $(\Omega,\mathcal{F},\mathbb{P})$ on which there exists a sequence of i.i.d. random variables $(Y_{n}:n\in \mathbb{N})$ all with distribution $m$.

Consider now the infinite product space
$$
E=\mathbb{R}^{\mathbb{N}}=\{ x = (x_{n} : n \in \mathbb{N}) : x_{n} \in \mathbb{R}\text{ for all }n \}
$$
and the $\sigma$-algebra $\mathcal{E}$ on $E$ generated by the coordinate maps $X_{n}(x)=x_{n}$:
$$
\mathcal{E}=\sigma(X_{n}:n\in \mathbb{N}).
$$
Note that $\mathcal{E}$ is also generated by the $\pi$-system
$$
\mathcal{A}=\left\{ \prod_{n\in \mathbb{N}}^{}A_{n} : A_{n}\in \mathcal{B}\text{ for all }n, A_{n}=\mathbb{R}\text{ for sufficiently large }n \right\}, 
$$
i.e. all finite rectangular products of measurable sets. Now, define $Y:\Omega\to E$ by $Y(\omega)=(Y_{n}(\omega):n\in \mathbb{N})$. Then, $Y$ is measurable and the image measure $\mu=\mathbb{P}\circ Y^{-1}$ satisfies, for all $A=\prod_{n\in \mathbb{N}}^{}A_{n}\in \mathcal{A}$,
$$
\mu(A)=\prod_{n\in \mathbb{N}}^{}m(A_{n}).
$$
By uniqueness of extension from a generating $\pi$-system, $\mu$ is the unique measure on $E$ with this property. Note that under the pushforward $\mu$, the coordinate maps $(X_{n}:n\in \mathbb{N})$ are themselves a sequence of independent random variables all with law $m$.

As promised:

> [!theorem]
> The shift map is an ergodic measure-preserving transformation.

> [!proof]-
> Showing that it is measurable and measure-preserving amounts to checking on the $\pi$-system, which isn't hard. Now, we will show that $\theta$ is ergodic; we will show that elements of $\mathcal{E}_{\theta}$ (i.e. invariant sets under $\theta$) occur with probability 0 or 1.

> $$
> \mathcal{T}_{n}=\sigma(X_{m}:m\geq n+1),\quad \mathcal{T}=\bigcap_{n}^{}\mathcal{T}_{n}.

> For any $A=\prod_{n\in \mathbb{N}}^{}A_{n}\in \mathcal{A}$, we have
> $$
> \theta^{-n}(A)=\{ X_{n+k}\in A_{k}\text{ for all }k \}\in \mathcal{T}_{n},
> $$
> and since $\mathcal{T}_{n}$ is a $\sigma$-algebra, this implies that $\theta^{-n}(A)\in \mathcal{T}_{n}$ for all $A\in \mathcal{E}$. Since elements of $\mathcal{E}_{\theta}$ satisfy $\theta^{-n}(A)=A$, this tells us that $\mathcal{E}_{\theta}\in \mathcal{T}$. Hence $\theta$ is ergodic by the Kolmogorov zero-one law.
