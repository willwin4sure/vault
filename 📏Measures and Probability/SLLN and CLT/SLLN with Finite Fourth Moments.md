We include this theorem since it admits an elementary proof. It is largely superseded by the true [[Strong Law of Large Numbers]], however.

## Statement

> [!theorem]
> Let $(X_{n}:n\in \mathbb{N})$ be a sequence of independent random variables such that, for some constants $\mu$ and $M<\infty$,
> $$
> \mathbb{E}[X_{n}]=\mu,\quad \mathbb{E}[X_{n}^{4}]\leq M
> $$
> for all $n$. Set $S_{n}=X_{1}+\cdots+X_{n}$. Then, $\frac{S_{n}}{n}\to \mu$ a.s. as $n\to \infty$.

## Proof
