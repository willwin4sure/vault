Fundamental to statistics, the strong law of large numbers tells us that given a large number of independent samples of a value, the sample mean converges almost surely to the true mean.

For curiosity's sake, there is some reading about an elementary proof of SLLN that assumes finite fourth moments:

1. [[SLLN with Finite Fourth Moments]]

However, we will prove the full statement with some [[â›ºErgodic Theory Homepage|ergodic theory]].
## Statement

> [!theorem] Theorem (SLLN)
> Let $(Y_{n}:n\in \mathbb{N})$ be a sequence of independent, identically distributed, integrable random variables with mean $\mu$. Set $S_{n}=Y_{1}+\cdots+Y_{n}$. Then,
> $$
> \frac{S_{n}}{n}\xrightarrow[n\to \infty]{\text{a.s.}} \nu.
> $$

## Proof
