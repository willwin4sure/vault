*From the [[📏Measures and Probability Portal]].*

Two of the billboard results in basic probability theory and fundamental to statistics, the strong law of large numbers and the central limit theorem tell us about the convergence and distribution of an average of many i.i.d. random variables.
## Main Sequence

First, learn about SLLN, which is nuked by the [[⛺Ergodic Theory Homepage|ergodic theory]] that we have developed.

1. [[Strong Law of Large Numbers]]

Then, learn about CLT, a fruit from our labor with [[⛺Fourier Transforms Homepage|Fourier transforms]].

2. [[Central Limit Theorem]]
