> I have to pay a certain sum, which I have collected in my pocket. I take the bills and coins out of my pocket and give them to the creditor in the order I find them until I have reached the total sum. This is the Riemann integral. But I can proceed differently. After I have taken all the money out of my pocket I order the bills and coins according to identical values and then I pay the several heaps one after the other to the creditor. This is my integral.

## Main Sequence

First, relearn integration from your basic calculus class, this time using the Lebesgue integral instead of the Riemann integral (philosophically, we chop horizontally instead of vertically). We will reprove many of the facts you have learned, formally.

1. [[Lebesgue Integration]]
2. [[Monotone Convergence Theorem]]
3. [[Lebesgue Integrals Behave]]
4. [[Fatou's Lemma]]
5. [[Dominated Convergence Theorem]]
6. [[Transformations of Integrals]]
7. [[The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus]]
8. [[u-Substitution]]
9. [[Differentiation Under the Integral Sign]]

Next, investigate how to integrate over multiple variables. This includes a discussion of when it is valid to swap order of integration.

8. [[Product Measure]]
9. [[Fubini's Theorem]]
10. [[Laws of Independent Random Variables]]
