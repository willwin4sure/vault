> I have to pay a certain sum, which I have collected in my pocket. I take the bills and coins out of my pocket and give them to the creditor in the order I find them until I have reached the total sum. This is the Riemann integral. But I can proceed differently. After I have taken all the money out of my pocket I order the bills and coins according to identical values and then I pay the several heaps one after the other to the creditor. This is my integral.

In this part of the course, we introduce the notion of Lebesgue integration. This will agree with Riemann integration for most practical integrals, but it has better convergence properties.
## Main Sequence

First, relearn integration from your basic AP calculus class, this time chopping horizontally instead of vertically. We will reprove, formally, many of the facts you have learned.

1. [[Lebesgue Integration]]
2. [[Monotone Convergence Theorem]]
3. [[Dominated Convergence Theorem]]
4. [[Transformations of Integrals]]
5. [[The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus]]
6. [[Integration Techniques]]

Next, investigate how to integrate over multiple variables. This includes a discussion of when it is valid to swap order of integration.
