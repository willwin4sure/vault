Consider some stochastic process $(X_{n}:n\in \mathbb{N})$.

Intuitively, tail events are those whose occurrence can still be determined if an arbitrarily large but finite initial segment of the $X_{n}$ are removed.

> [!proof]-
> We will show that $\mathcal{T}$ is independent of $\mathcal{F}_{\infty}=\sigma(X_{n}:n\in \mathbb{N})$. To do so, spam the [[Independence|$\pi$-system independence check]]. First, let $\mathcal{F}_{n}=\sigma(X_{1},\dots,X_{n})$. Then, $\mathcal{F}_{n}$ is generated by the $\pi$-system of events

> Evidently $\mathbb{P}(A\cap B)=\mathbb{P}(A)\mathbb{P}(B)$ for any such events, by independence of $X_{i}$. Hence $\mathcal{F}_{n}$ and $\mathcal{T}_{n}$ are independent; it follows that $\mathcal{F}_{n}$ and $\mathcal{T}$ are independent for all $n$. Now, note that $\bigcup_{n}^{}\mathcal{F}_{n}$ is a $\pi$-system generating $\mathcal{F}_{\infty}$, so $\mathcal{F}_{\infty}$ is independent of $\mathcal{T}$.

> However, $\mathcal{T}\subseteq \mathcal{F}_{\infty}$, which means that for any $A\in \mathcal{T}$, we have that $\mathbb{P}(A)=\mathbb{P}(A\cap A)=\mathbb{P}(A)\mathbb{P}(A)$, so $\mathbb{P}(A)\in \{ 0,1 \}$, as desired.

> Finally, if $X$ is $\mathcal{T}$-measurable, then $\mathbb{P}(X\leq x)$ takes values in $\{ 0,1 \}$ for all $x$, so $X$ is almost surely constant (consider the infimum of points $x$ where $\mathbb{P}(X\leq x)=1$).
