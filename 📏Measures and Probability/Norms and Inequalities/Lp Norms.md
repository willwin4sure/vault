This short section introduces the $L^{p}$ norm, which is a way of measuring distance between two measurable functions.

Work over a measure space $(E,\mathcal{E},\mu)$.

Note that $\| f \|_{p}\leq \mu(E)^{1/p}\| f \|_{\infty}$ for all $1\leq p<\infty$.

Here is another notion of [[Convergence of Measurable Functions|convergence of measurable functions]]. This is stronger than convergence in measure, and on a separate branch from convergence almost everywhere (neither implies the other).

> [!definition] Definition (Convergence in $L^{p}$)
> For any $1\leq p\leq \infty$ and $f_{n},f\in L^{p}$, we say that $f_{n}$ ==converges in $L^p$== to $f$ if $\| f_{n}-f \|_{p}\to 0$.
