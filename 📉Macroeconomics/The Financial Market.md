[[The Goods Market|Last]], we discussed why fiscal policy is a powerful tool for governments to jumpstart economies, by injecting money into a consumer feedback loop. In the next couple of classes, we will discuss ==monetary policy==, actions that the central bank can take to achieve sustainable economic growth.

This is a great front-line system to protect the economy: it is much more nimble than fiscal policy.

## Federal Reserve System

The U.S. Central Bank consists of a board of 7 governors in DC appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate, as well as 12 regional banks (only 4 of these bank presidents vote with the governors, one fixed as New York).

## Demand for Money

For simplicity, we will reduce investors' portfolio problem to choosing between only two assets:

* ==money==, which is used for transactions but accrues no interest.
* ==bonds==, which pay a positive interest rate $i$, but cannot be used for transactions.

There is a trade-off here! Money allows you to do more transactions, but you give up earning the interest rate on it. At an aggregate level,
$$
M^{d} = \$Y\cdot L(i),
$$
where $L(i)$ is the liquidity, a decreasing function in $i$.

In our simple model, the central bank decides to supply a certain amount of money $M^{s}$, and at equilibrium, this is set equal to $M^{d}$. Here's a picture:
