## Feedback Loop of Aggregate Demand

In general, demand increases production, which leads to more income, which then leads to more demand! This holds in macroeconomics because we are investigating things in aggregate, but the feedback loop isn't there in microeconomics, since consumers will disperse their excess income across other goods.

## Composition of Aggregate Demand

1. **Consumption** $C$: the goods and services purchased by consumers.
2. **Investment** $I$: the sum of nonresidential and residential investment.
3. **Government spending** $G$: purchases of goods and services by the federal, state, and local governments, excluding **government transfers**.
4. **Exports** $X$: purchases of U.S. goods and services by foreigners.
5. **Imports** $IM$: purchases of foreign goods and services by U.S. consumers, firms, and government.
6. **Inventory Investment**: the difference between production and sales.

In this course, we will set inventory investment to 0, and for now, $X=IM=0$ (closed economy).

For now, we make the following behavioral assumptions:

1. *Exogenous variables* (fixed) are $I=\overline{I}$ and $G,T$ (taxes). Note that $G,T$ define the ==fiscal policy==.
2. The main *endogenous variable* is $C=C(Y_{D})$, an increasing function of ==disposable income== $Y_{D}=Y-T$.

## Consumption Function

For now, let's assume that the consumption function is a linear function:
$$
C=c_{0}+c_{1}Y_{D}.
$$
The parameter $c_{1}$ is called the ==marginal propensity to consume==: how much additional consumption is generated by an extra unit of disposable income.

The parameter $c_{0}$ is ==autonomous consumption== and captures many unmodeled factors such as wealth.

> The equilibrium output in this economy is
> $$
> Y=\frac{1}{1-c_{1}}[c_{0}-c_{1}T+\overline{I}+G].
> $$

We do this by writing
$$
Z=c_{0}+c_{1}(Y-T)+\overline{I}+G.
$$
==Equilibrium in the goods markets=== requires that $Y=Z$, and we assume that output is equal to aggregate demand.

We call the term $\frac{1}{1-c_{1}}$ the ==multiplier==. This should remind you of an infinite geometric series, and it is because of the feedback loop amplifying by $c_{1}$ each time. Here's a picture:

What happens if we shifted autonomous consumption $c_{0}$ up by $\$1$ billion? Here is another picture:

![[aggregate_demand_shift.png|center|384]]

The first immediate change is that the aggregate demand curve shifts upwards by $\$1$ billion. However, this is not the entire effect, since now income has also been increased by the same amount; they want to consume more again, this time $c_{1}\cdot\$1$ billion. And so on...

This explains why ==fiscal policy==, the use of government revenue collection and expenditure to influence the economy, is a really powerful tool to fight recessions.
## Alternative Derivation

Another way to derive this is to set total investments equal to total saving, something called the ==IS relation==. The private and government savings are $S=Y_{D}-C=Y-T-C$ and $S^{G}=T-G$. 

In equilibrium, $I=S+S^{G}=Y-C-G$, giving the same relationship $Y=C+I+G$.

## Paradox of Saving

If society saves more, then it turns out that aggregate output actually decreases. You want people spending money! Yet individually, you certainly should save money! Maybe this is why people aren't taught good habits with their money.
