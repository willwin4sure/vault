[[The Goods Market|Last]], we discussed why fiscal policy is a powerful tool for governments to jumpstart economies, by injecting money into a consumer feedback loop. In the next couple of classes, we will discuss ==monetary policy==, actions that the central bank can take to achieve sustainable economic growth.

This is a great front-line system to protect the economy: it is much more nimble than fiscal policy.

## Federal Reserve System

The U.S. Central Bank consists of a board of 7 governors in DC appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate, as well as 12 regional banks (only 4 of these bank presidents vote with the governors, one fixed as New York).

## Demand for Money

For simplicity, we will reduce investors' portfolio problem to choosing between only two assets: ==money==, which is used for transactions but accrues no interest, and ==bonds==, which pay a positive interest rate $i$, but cannot be used for transactions.
