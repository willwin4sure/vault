Sometimes it's hard to specify priors and costs to run the Bayesian approach.

An alternative idea is to maximize $P_{D}$ subject to some constraint on $P_{F}$, i.e.
$$
\text{argmax}_{\hat{H}(\bullet)}P_{D}\quad\text{subject to }P_{F}\leq \alpha.
$$
This is called the ==Neyman-Pearson criterion==.

There are a lot of practical scenarios where this is not useful. For example, if one of the distributions under a hypothesis is discrete. Further, simple LRTs are only optimal among deterministic rules, and randomized classifiers could do better.
