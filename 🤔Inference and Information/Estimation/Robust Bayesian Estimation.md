This page contains some alternate loss functions. The quadratic cost function for BLS is computationally attractive, but it is quite sensitive to outliers. Ideally, we do some mix with an absolute error cost function.

You basically take the parabola, and then at some point extend in a straight line instead.

Here's yet another cost function with similar behavior:
