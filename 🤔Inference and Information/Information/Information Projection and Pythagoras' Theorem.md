In this section, we introduce the notion of an information projection, which tells us which distribution in $\mathcal{P}$ we are least surprised to observe given that our model of the world is $q$.

> [!definition] (I-projection)
> The ==I-projection== of a distribution $q$ onto a nonempty and closed set of distributions $\mathcal{P}$ is the distribution $p^{*}$ such that
> $$
> p^{*}=\mathop{\arg\min}_{p \in \mathcal{P}}\ D(p\parallel q).
> $$

This optimum exists since $D(p\parallel q)$ is nonnegative and continuous in $p$, and $\mathcal{P}$ is compact. The projection is not necessarily unique, but when $\mathcal{P}$ is a convex set, it is.

> [!remark]
> Suppose you are doing inference, and you observe $q$ and want to find the best model inside $\mathcal{P}$. The correct way to do this is with the ==M-projection== $p^{*}=\mathop{\arg\min}_{p \in \mathcal{P}}\ D(q\parallel p)$. However, the I-projection is often easier to compute, and has some other nice properties.

I don't think Pythagoras came up with the next one. 

> [!theorem] (Pythagoras' Theorem, Information Version)

> [!claim] (Pythagoras' Corollary)
> The I-projection $p^{*}$ of any $q$ not on the boundary of $\mathcal{P}^{\mathcal{Y}}$ onto a family $\mathcal{P}$ cannot lie on a boundary component of $\mathcal{P}^{\mathcal{Y}}$ unless all of $\mathcal{P}$ is confined to that particular boundary component.

> [!proof]- Immediate
> Otherwise $D(p \parallel q)$ will be finite yet $D(p \parallel p^{*})$ will be infinite, if we pick $p \in \mathcal{P}$ outside of that boundary component.
