1. [[Single-Parameter Exponential Families]]
2. [[Efficient Estimators and Exponential Families]]
3. [[]]

Next, the topic of sufficient statistics, which crystallize our information from observations to a smaller set of features.


Then, a quick side-note on some useful inequalities:

Finally, a discussion of the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm.
