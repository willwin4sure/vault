In this section, we cover several important techniques in inference: exponential families, sufficient statistics, and the EM algorithm.

## Main Sequence

First, a discussion of exponential families, which encompass nearly every named distribution you know of.

1. [[Single-Parameter Exponential Families]]
2. [[Efficient Estimators and Exponential Families]]
3. [[Multi-Parameter Exponential Families]]
4. [[Local Families of Distributions]]

Next, the topic of sufficient statistics, which crystallize our information from observations to a smaller set of features in a lossless manner.

5. [[Sufficient Statistics]]

Then, a quick side-note on some useful inequalities:

6. [[Some Useful Inequalities]]

Finally, a discussion of the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm.

7. [[The Expectation Maximization (EM) Algorithm]]
8. [[The EM Algorithm on Exponential Families]]
