[[Gaussian Spaces and Processes|Last]], we defined what it means for a Gaussian process on $I=[0,\infty)$ to have covariance function $\Gamma(s,t)$. We also proposed a definition for Brownian motion to be such a Gaussian process where $\Gamma(s,t)=\min\{ s, t \}$.

## Kolmogorov Extension Theorem

The Kolmogorov extension theorem tells us that on the probability space $(\mathbb{R}^{I},\mathcal{B}_{\mathbb{R}}^{\otimes I})$, there exists a unique probability measure $\nu$ with finite dimensional marginals $\nu_{J}=\mathcal{N}(0,\Gamma_{J\times J})$ for all finite $J\subseteq I$. Now, for any $\omega \in \mathbb{R}^{I}$, we let $X_{t}(\omega)=\omega_{t}$ for $t\in I$. Then, $(X_{t})_{t\in I}$ is a Gaussian process with covariance function $\Gamma$.

However, there is a **pretty major issue**: for any $\omega$, the map $t\mapsto X_{t}(\omega)$ may not be continuous, or even measurable!

Here are our desired properties:

> [!definition] (Standard Brownian motion)
> A ==standard Brownian motion== is a stochastic process $(B_{t})_{t\geq 0}$ such that $B_{0}=0$, $B_{t}-B_{s}\sim \mathcal{N}(0,t-s)$, we have independent increments, and there are continuous sample paths $t\mapsto B_{t}(\omega)$ for all $\omega \in\Omega$.

The Kolmogorov extension theorem gives us some process $(X_{t})_{t\geq 0}$ that has all the requirements (via the covariance function) except the last one. We will modify the Gaussian process to guarantee continuity while preserving the other three properties.

## Kolmogorov Continuity Lemma

> [!definition] ($\alpha$-Hölder continuity)
> For a function $f:\mathbb{R}\to \mathbb{R}$, we say that it is ==$\alpha$-Hölder continuous== if there exists some global constant $C$ such that $|f(x)-f(y)|\leq C|x-y|^{\alpha}$ for all $x,y\in \mathbb{R}$. 

> [!remark]
> The case of $\alpha=1$ is the Lipschitz condition. If $\alpha>1$, then the only such functions are constant.

Consider the dyadic rational values $D_{n}=\left\{  \frac{i}{2^{n}} : 0\leq i<2^{n}  \right\}$, and write $D=\bigcup_{n\geq 0}^{}D_{n}$.

> $$
> for all $i,n$ and some global constant $K$. Then, $|f(s)-f(t)|\leq K'|s-t|^{\alpha}$ for all $s,t\in D$. We might get a worse global constant $K'$ compared to $K$.

> [!proof]- Binary lifting
> Suppose we are going from $s$ to $t$ which are far away from each other. We don't want to add up bounds from each individual increment; instead, we group together the jumps that we can do over lower dyadics.
> 
> Suppose $\frac{1}{2^{p}}$ is the largest block that we can fit inside of the interval from $s$ to $t$. This allows us to find some $s_{0}\in[s,t]$ that is in $D_{p}$. Now do a dyadic expansion in both directions. The computation amounts to the fact that

> Under the assumption that $\varepsilon>\alpha q$, we know that the sum of these over $n\geq 0$ converges, meaning by the first Borel-Cantelli lemma, $\mathbb{P}(A_{n}\text{ i.o.})=0$. Restrict to the case where $\omega$ falls outside of the measure-zero event where $\{ A_{n}\text{ i.o.} \}$. Therefore, there exists some $N(\omega)$ such that $\omega \not\in A_{n}$ for all $n > N(\omega)$.

> [!definition] (Modification of stochastic process)
> We say that $\tilde{X}$ is a ==modification== of $X$ if $\mathbb{P}(X_{t}=\tilde{X}_{t})=1$ for any fixed time $t$, though $\mathbb{P}(X_{t}=\tilde{X}_{t}\text{ for all }t)$ might not be $1$.

A modification will always have identical finite-dimensional marginals. This preserves the first three properties of Brownian motion that we want.

> [!claim] ($\alpha$-Hölder continuous modification of stochastic processes)

> $$
> \left| \tilde{X}_{t}(\omega)-\tilde{X}_{s}(\omega) \right| \leq K_{\alpha}'(\omega)|s-t|^{\alpha}
> $$
> for all $s,t\in[0,1]$.
>

> [!proof]- Complete from dyadics
> Define $\tilde{X}_{t}(\omega)=\lim_{ s \to t,\ s \in D }X_{s}(\omega)$. Note that this limit only looks at $X$ on dyadics $D$. $\tilde{X}$ is $\alpha$-Hölder continuous almost surely because of the last two claims: if we look at the difference $|\tilde{X}_{s}-\tilde{X}_{t}|$, we approximate using $s',t'\in D$. In the case that $\omega$ lies in the measure-zero event that this doesn't hold, we can set $\tilde{X}_{t}(\omega)=0$ instead.
> 
> We do need to show that $\tilde{X}$ is actually a modification of $X$. For any given $t$, the assumption $\mathbb{E}\left[ |X_{s}-X_{t}|^{q} \right]\leq C|s-t|^{1+\varepsilon}$ implies that as $D\ni s\to t$, we have that $X_{s}\to X_{t}$ in $L^{q}$ but also that $X_{s}\to \tilde{X}_{t}$ a.s. by definition, so $X_{t}=\tilde{X}_{t}$ almost surely.

The three claims above constitute the ==Kolmogorov continuity lemma==. This applies to any stochastic process $(X_{t})_{t\geq 0}$, as long as the moment estimate holds.

## Application to Brownian Motion

We know that $|X_{s}-X_{t}|\sim \mathcal{N}(0,t-s)$, which means that
$$
\mathbb{E}[|X_{s}-X_{t}|^{q}]\sim(t-s)^{q/2}.
$$
Then, $\varepsilon=\frac{q}{2}-1$, so our bound gives us that Brownian motion is $\alpha$-Hölder continuous for all $\alpha< \frac{1}{2}$. This is essentially optimal: even $\alpha=\frac{1}{2}$ does not work!

So far, we've worked on $[0,1]$, which can be scaled to $[0,M]$ for any $M$. How would we extend to $\mathbb{R}$?

> [!theorem]
> Let $(X_{t})_{t\geq 0}$ be a Gaussian process with covariance function $\Gamma(s,t)=\min\{ s,t \}$. Then $X$ has a modification $B$ that is locally $\alpha$-Holder continuous, i.e. $|B_{t}(\omega)-B_{s}(\omega)|\leq K_{\alpha,M}(\omega)|s-t|^{\alpha}$ for all $s,t\in[0,M]$.

This is because we cannot get a uniform moment bound on the entire real line, so our constant $K$ must depend on the size $M$.
