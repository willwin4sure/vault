## Constructing Brownian Motion

Our first goal is to give an informal introduction to *Brownian motion*. The rigorous definition will come later.

We all know the ==standard Gaussian density== on $\mathbb{R}$, given by
$$
g(x)=\frac{1}{2\pi}\exp \left( -\frac{x^2}{2} \right).
$$
Then, we write $Z\sim \mathcal{N}(0,1)$ if $Z$ is an $\mathbb{R}$-valued random variable with density $g$.

If we consider i.i.d. random variables $X_{1},X_{2},\dots,X_{n}\sim \text{Unif}(\{\pm 1\})$ and their sum $S_{n}=\sum_{i=1}^{n}X_{i}$, then by the central limit theorem, $\frac{S_{n}}{\sqrt{ n }}\xrightarrow[]{(d)}\mathcal{N}(0,1)$. 

This is called a ==simple random walk== $(S_{n})$. Over time $n$, $S_{n}$ typically covers $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{ n })$ distance.

> Rescale time by $n$ and space by $\sqrt{ n }$.

This gives us a process $X^{(n)}(t)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{ n }}S_{nt}$. For any *fixed* time $t\geq 0$,
$$
X^{(n)}(t)\xrightarrow[n\to \infty]{(d)}\mathcal{N}(0,t)
$$
by the central limit theorem. In fact, the entire process $\left( X^{(n)}(t) \right)_{t\geq 0}$ converges in distribution as $n\to \infty$ to ==standard Brownian motion== $(B(t))_{t\geq 0}$. This convergence is with respect to a suitable topology on the space of paths.

Some important basic properties are that
* For all $s\leq t$, $B_{t}-B_{s}\sim \mathcal{N}(0,t-s)$.
* For all $t_{1}\leq t_{2}\leq t_{3}\leq t_{4}$, $B_{t_{4}}-B_{t_{3}}$ is independent to $B_{t_{2}}-B_{t_{1}}$.

## Itô's Formula

This is the central result of stochastic calculus, and it will take some time to prove.

Suppose we are given the stochastic differential equation
$$
dX_{t}=\mu_{t}dt+\sigma_{t}dB_{t}.
$$
The first term is ==drift== (it's some *signal*), while the second term is ==volatility== (it's the *noise*). For now, we can think of this informally as $X_{t+dt}-X_{t}=\mu_{t}\cdot dt+\sigma_{t}\cdot \mathcal{N}(0,dt)$.

The size of the second term is typically much much larger, as it is order $\sqrt{ dt }$ rather than order $dt$. In a deterministic process, the second term would wash out the first one. However, because it is actually random, these independent large changes will average out.

Now, let $f:\mathbb{R}\to \mathbb{R}$ be a twice-differentiable function. ==Itô's formula== characterizes the behavior of $f(X_{t})$, as follows.

> [!theorem] (Itô's Formula)
> $$
> df(X_{t})=\underbrace{\left( f'(X_{t})\mu_{t} + \frac{f''(X_{t})\sigma_{t}^2}{2} \right)}_{\text{drift}}dt + \underbrace{f'(X_{t})\sigma_{t}}_{\text{volatility}}dB_{t}.

We can derive this mathematically. First, by a Taylor expansion, we can write
$$
\begin{align*}
df(X_{t})&=f'(X_{t})dX_{t}+\frac{1}{2}f''(X_{t})(dX_{t})^2\\
&=f'(X_{t})(\mu_{t}dt+\sigma_{t}dB_{t})+\frac{1}{2}f''(X_{t})(\mu_{t}dt+\sigma_{t}dB_{t})^{2}.
\end{align*}
$$
The first term is left as is, while for the second term, since $dB_{t}$ is on order $\sqrt{ dt }$, the only nonnegligible term is $\sigma_{t}^2(dB_{t})^2$. However, we can also note that $(dB_{t})^2-dt$ is a mean zero random variable with variance on order $(dt)^2$, so it is negligible when aggregated over time. 

Summing terms gives the desired formula.

## Brownian Motion is Conformally Invariant

First, let's review a bit of complex analysis. Given a function $f:D\to \mathbb{C}$ where $D\subseteq \mathbb{C}$ is open, we say that $f$ is ==holomorphic== (complex differentiable) at $z\in D$ if
$$
f'(z)=\lim_{ h \to 0 } \frac{f(z+h)-f(z)}{h}\in \mathbb{C}
$$
exists. Note that $h\to 0$ in $\mathbb{C}$; in particular, the limit must work from any direction. We will write $z=x+iy$ and $f=u+iv$ where $x$, $y$, $u$, and $v$ are real-valued. 

By equating the cases where $h\to 0$ along $\mathbb{R}$ or $i\mathbb{R}$, we get that
$$
u_{x}+iv_{x}=\frac{ \partial f }{ \partial x } =\frac{1}{i}\frac{ \partial f }{ \partial y }=v_{y}-iu_{y}.
$$
This gives us the ==Cauchy-Riemann equations==
$$
\begin{align*}
u_{x}&=v_{y},\\
v_{x}&=-u_{y}.
\end{align*}
$$
This further implies that both $u(x,y)$ and $v(x,y)$ are ==harmonic==, as $\nabla^2u=\nabla^2v=0$.

Finally, we say that $f:D\to D'$ is ==conformal== if it is holomorphic with a holomorphic inverse, i.e. $f'(z)\neq0$ everywhere.

We define this because we want to prove the following famous fact:

> [!claim]
> Brownian motion in $\mathbb{C}$ is conformally invariant.

First, we need to define Brownian motion in $\mathbb{C}$. This is done the way you expect: let $(X_{t},Y_{t})$ be two standard Brownian motions in $\mathbb{R}$. Then, $Z_{t}=X_{t}+iY_{t}$ is a standard Brownian motion in $\mathbb{C}$.

Now, let $f:D\to D'$ be conformal, and write $f=u+iv$. We will start a Brownian motion $Z_{t}$ inside $D$, which terminates once it hits the boundary.

We can similarly derive [[Informal Overview#^86f449|Itô's Formula]] in two dimensions. We can use the same Taylor expansion idea to get
$$
du(Z_{t})=\begin{bmatrix}
u_{x}(Z_{t}) & u_{y}(Z_{t})
\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}
dX_t \\
dY_{t}
\end{bmatrix}+\frac{1}{2}\begin{bmatrix}
dX_{t} & dY_{t}
\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}
u_{xx} & u_{xy} \\
u_{yx} & u_{yy}
\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}
dX_{t} \\
dY_{t}
\end{bmatrix}.
$$
Let's analyze the second order term. The cross terms are of the form $u_{xy}dX_{t}dY_{t}$, which have mean zero and variance on the order of $(dt)^2$; these vanish. The main diagonal term is nonnegligibly different from $\frac{1}{2}(u_{xx}+u_{yy})dt$, which also vanishes since $u$ is harmonic.

Therefore, we can write
$$
\begin{bmatrix}
du(Z_{t}) \\
dv(Z_{t})
\end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix}
u_{x} & u_{y} \\
v_{x} & v_{y}
\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}
dX_{t} \\
dY_{t}
\end{bmatrix}.
$$
However, the Cauchy-Riemann equations imply that this is just a spiral similarity: it's some rotation matrix plus and dilation by $|f'(z)|$. Yet the standard 2D Gaussian is rotationally symmetric, so the rotation does nothing to the distribution. The scaling also doesn't affect the ==trace== of the Brownian motion; it only changes the time reparameterization.

## A Cute Application: Cauchy Distributions

> [!problem]
> Start a standard Brownian motion in $\mathbb{C}$ at $iy$, and terminate it when it hits the real axis. What is the distribution of the stopping location?

> [!proof]- Solution
> Perform a conformal map that sends the upper half-plane to the unit disc, where the $x$-axis gets mapped to the unit circle. We also want to send $iy$ to the origin. The precise function that does this is
> $$
> f(z)=\frac{i-z / y}{i+z / y}.
> $$
> Since we only care about the hitting location of the Brownian motion (and not the time), and the trace of Brownian motion is conformally invariant, this means that the hitting location must be uniform on the unit circle.
> 
> Therefore, to get the distribution of the hitting location on the real axis, we just determine the length of the arc on the unit circle that it gets mapped to. We can compute this by looking at
> $$
> |f'(x)|=\frac{2y}{x^{2}+y^{2}}
> $$
> over $x \in \mathbb{R}$ and integrating to get
> $$
> \mathbb{P}(Z_{\tau}\in[a,b])=\frac{1}{2\pi}\int_{a}^{b} \frac{2y}{(x^{2}+y^{2})} \, dx. 
> $$
> This is called a Cauchy distribution, which can also be generated by shooting a ray from $(0,y)$ to the $x$-axis along a uniformly random angle. This distribution is famous for having no defined finite moments at least one.

We call $P_{y}(x)=\frac{y}{\pi(x^{2}+y^{2})}$ the ==Poisson kernel== for the half-plane. This also comes up in the following context: if $b:\mathbb{R}\to \mathbb{R}$ is sufficiently nice, then the unique harmonic function $h$ on the half-plane with $h|_{\mathbb{R}}=b$ is given by
$$
h(x,y)=\mathbb{E}\left[ b(Z_{\tau}) | Z_{0}=x+iy \right].
$$
You've seen this problem in electrodynamics when solving for the electric potential $V$ under $\nabla^{2}V=0$, given its values on the boundary.

However, since $Z_{t}$ is a Brownian motion, we can further simplify this as
$$
h(x,y)=\mathbb{E}[b(x+Z_{\tau})|Z_{0}=iy]=\int_{\mathbb{R}} P_{y}(s)b(x+s) \, ds=(b *P_{y})(x),
$$
the **convolution of the boundary condition with the Poisson kernel**! We will discuss later in the semester the general connection between Brownian motion and harmonic functions.
