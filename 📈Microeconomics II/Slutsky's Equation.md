Recall the definitions of [[Hicksian Demand and Expenditures#Income and Substitution Effects|income and substitution effects]]. The total change in uncompensated demand per change in price is their sum:

> [!theorem] (Slutsky's equation)
> The own-price version states that
> $$
> \frac{ \partial x^{*} }{ \partial p_{x} } = \frac{ \partial x^{c} }{ \partial p_{x} } - x^{*} \frac{ \partial x^{*} }{ \partial I },
> $$
> while the cross-price version states that
> $$
> \frac{ \partial x^{*} }{ \partial p_{y} } = \frac{ \partial x^{c} }{ \partial p_{y} } - y^{*} \frac{ \partial x^{*} }{ \partial I }.
> $$

> [!question]
> Show that to be a [[Marshallian Demand and Indirect Utility#^7b1032|Giffen good]], you must be [[Marshallian Demand and Indirect Utility#^7b1032|inferior]].
