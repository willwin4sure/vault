*From the [[üìèMicroeconomics Portal]].*

Microeconomics is the study of how individuals and firms make themselves as well off as possible in a world of **scarcity**.

Everything in life is a tradeoff, because of <span style="color:#0088ff">opportunity costs</span>: every action‚Äîor inaction‚Äîhas a cost in terms of *what could have been done instead*.

Our goal in this course is to build simplified **models** of how the economy works. We will try to understand these models on three levels: intuitively, graphically, and mathematically.

We will also study the economy using both <span style="color:#0088ff">positive analysis</span> and <span style="color:#0088ff">normative analysis</span>. The former is a study of the way that things are, while the latter is the study of the way things ought to be (in our opinion).
