A market is a place where buyers and sellers come together to negotiate transactions. The interaction of the supply and demand in the market yields the price, as well as the quantity. 

> [!definition] Definition (Supply curve)
> The <span style="color:#0088ff">quantity supplied</span> $Q_{s}(P)$ specifies the amount of quantity producers, in aggregate, are willing to supply given a certain price. 

> [!definition] Definition (Demand curve)
> The <span style="color:#0088ff">quantity demanded</span> $Q_{d}(P)$ specifies the amount of quantity consumers, in aggregate, are willing to pay for given a certain price.

Generally, we plot these on the same graph, with axes $P$ and $Q$:

> The supply curve is upwards-sloping, while the demand curve is downwards-sloping.

> [!explanation]-
> If the price is higher, then producers are more incentivized to make the good. For example, if a farmer sees that carrot prices are high, she may want to grow carrots instead of potatoes that season. If carrot prices are sufficiently through the roof, everyone should drop what they are doing and start growing carrots.

> On the other hand, the higher the price, the less willing consumers are to pay for the good. 
> 
> In reality, these curves should be step functions: we could imagine there are some die-hard carrot fans which represent the top left side of the demand curve. Even if prices are sky-high, they are still willing to buy. As prices lower, however, more and more people are willing to buy carrots at the given price.

## Market Equilibrium

> [!definition] Definition (Equilibrium)
> We call the point where $Q_{s}(P)=Q_{d}(P)$ the <span style="color:#0088ff">market equilibrium</span>. This is the point at which both producers and consumers are happy to engage in the market transaction.

> [!idea]
> Perfectly competitive open markets converge to the equilibrium price and quantity.

> [!explanation]-
> Suppose the price were lower than the equilibrium price. Then, there is excess quantity demanded compared to the quantity supplied, meaning that people will be willing to pay more to get the limited quantity. This drives prices back up.
> 
> Now, suppose the price were higher than the equilibrium price. Then, there is excess quantity supplied compared to the quantity demanded, meaning that suppliers are willing to sell off their goods more cheaply. This drives prices back down.

## Motivating Example

> [!example] Example (eBay kidney auction)
> Auctions are great examples of perfectly competitive markets. Someone once offered one of their kidneys up for auction on eBay. Bidding started at $25,000, and the price climbed to $5 million before the auction was shut down, because it is illegal to sell bodily organs on the market.

> [!explanation]-
> **Positive question:** why did the price rise so high? Well, the supply of kidneys is very low, because of the very law making them illegal to sell. The demand of kidneys is also very high, since some people who are dying from kidney failure need them to live.
> 
> **Normative question:** why restrict this market? It benefits both rich people who need kidneys to live, and poor people who could use the money but don't need both of their kidneys. Well, it comes down to two reasons:
> 
> 1. Market failures (crime, misinformation, etc.)
> 2. Equity (perhaps feels exploitative when rich people can buy their way out of problems and poor people are incentivized to sell their organs)
> 
> This motivates a key question in economics: how freely should an economy function? Capitalistic economies (individuals and firms decide what to produce and consume, subject to some regulations) tend to perform better than command economies (government makes all production and allocation decisions).
