Last time, we discussed what happens in oligopoly when firms do not cooperate. However, we discovered that firms can perform better in aggregate by cooperating, and essentially forming a larger monopoly and splitting the profits; this is called a <span style="color:#0088ff">cartel</span>. 

## Comparing Profits

Continue the example from [[Oligopoly and Cournot Equilibrium#^511e64|last time]].

In the Cournot equilibrium, both airlines flew $64$ flights at a price of $339-2\cdot 64=211$ and a marginal cost of $147$, leading to individual profits of $64(211-147)=4096$ each.

If they formed a cartel, the monopolistic strategy is to fly $96$ flights total (so $48$ flights each), leading to a price of $339-96=243$. The individual profits are then $48(243-147)=4608$, which is larger.

## Why Not Cartels?

### Economists' Reason

There is a fundamental *instability* because there is incentive for both people to cheat, as in the prisoner's dilemma.

For example, United could silently sell $50$ flights instead of $48$, leading to the prices falling to $241$ but new profits of $50(241-147)=4700$. However, American's profits would then fall to $48(241-147)=4512$. 

By cheating, United raises their profits and lowers American's profits. This decreases the total amount of profits earned by both (as it is no longer the optimal monopolistic solution). 

### Lawyers' Reason

**They're illegal!** This is what anti-trust laws are for. There are some exceptions, such as for the NFL right now, but they cause messy situations.

## Comparison

Perfect competition has the most quantity produced, but literally zero profit per producer. Monopoly has the least quantity produced, but the most profit per producer. Oligopoly lies somewhere in the middle. 

In terms of welfare, perfect competition has the highest welfare, but it is all in the form of consumer surplus. Monopoly has the most deadweight loss, on the other hand, but it has the most producer surplus.
