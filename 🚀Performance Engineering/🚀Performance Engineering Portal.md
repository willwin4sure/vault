From the MIT course [6.1060 Software Performance Engineering](https://student.mit.edu/catalog/search.cgi?search=6.1060) taught by Charles E. Leiserson, Saman Amarainghe, and Nir Shavit.

This class is about writing fast code.

> [!question]
> Is performance important?

Here are some examples of other software properties that you might care about:

* Correctness.
* Functionality.
* Security.
* Readability.
* Modularity.
* Scalability.
* Reliability.

> [!idea]
> Performance is the **currency** of computing. You can often "buy" these other needed properties with performance (since you trade them off).

Start by learning some history of the field and read up on a case study on matrix multiplication, which previews many topics we'll discuss in the class. ^8ffbd2
