In this section, we will talk about methods of boosting single-threaded performance.

Probably the most important method is *vectorization*, which may confer a large constant factor speedup (~4x or even ~8x).

## Main Sequence

2. [[Bentley Rules]]
3. [[x86-64 Primer]]
4. [[Computer Architecture]]
5. [[Vectorized Instructions]]
6. [[Compiler Vectorization]]
7. [[Manual Vectorization]]
8. [[C to Assembly]]

As an aside, you can also go look at how we time code and measure speedups in this class.
