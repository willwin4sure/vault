## Problems

Signed integers are represented in two's complement (in particular, `~x + x = -1`). This allows the hardware to treat them identically to unsigned integers for various operations.

> [!example] 
> Compute the largest power of `2` that divides `x`.

> [!proof]- Solution
>  `r = x & -x`. This is because `-x` flips all the bits in `x` and then adds `1`, so then the only bit that shows up in the `&` is the least significant bit set in `x`.

This also gives an efficient way to check if `x` is a power of `2` (see if it is equal to the largest power of `2` that divides `x`). There is an edge case when `x == 0`, however.

> A deBruijn sequence `s` of length $2^{k}$ is a cyclic bitstring such that every string of length `k` appears exactly once as a substring of `s`. The particular sequence in the code above must start with `k` zeros so that shifting to the left by multiplying with `x` is equivalent to the cyclic rotation supported by the deBruijn sequence.

[!proof]- Solution
There is a compiler built-in nowadays.

Parallel divide-and-conquer.

## Backtracking

> [!example]
> Place eight Queens in a chessboard such that no two Queens attack each other.

The basic algorithm uses recursive backtracking search by attempting to place a queen on each row. This is a simple recursive procedure, but how should we represent the board to facilitate Queen placement?

Let's make our algorithm generalizable for arbitrary board sizes up to `32`. The basic idea is to just have a bitmask of length `n` for the columns and two bitmasks of length `2 * n - 1` for the diagonals.
