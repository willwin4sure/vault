The PDP-11 hardware detects a number of program faults, such as:

* References to non-existent memory
* Unimplemented instructions
* Odd addresses where an even address is required

These faults cause the processor to ==trap== to a system routine. This causes the system to terminate the process and core dump its image on the file *core* in the current directory. Then, a debugger can be used to examine the state of the program.

Programs can be halted using the *interrupt* signal, generated by typing the `delete` character. This signal causes the program to cease execution without producing a *core* file; there is a *quit* signal used to force an image file to be produced, so that the remains can be inspected.

Hardware-generated faults and the interrupt and quit signals can be ignored or caught by a process. This can prevent unintended consequences, such as logging out preemptively or quitting from a text editor with unsaved changes. Unimplemented instructions could also be emulated.
