Notes from the article [The UNIX Time-Sharing System](https://dsf.berkeley.edu/cs262/unix.pdf) by D. M. Ritchie and K. Thompson, creators of the Unix operating system. (Ritchie also created C!)

Unix is an operating system written in C (originally in assembly language, but later translated). Linux and MacOS were built on it, so it's quite important.

This article was written in the good ol' days of the 1970s, where computers are 16-bit with 784 KB of main memory with moving-head disks with 200 MB of storage. Therefore, many things may seem dated, or are potentially obsolete.
