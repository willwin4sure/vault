#MIT #CS #ML

From the MIT graduate course [6.8200 Sensorimotor Learning](http://student.mit.edu/catalog/search.cgi?search=6.8200) taught by Pulkit Agrawal. 
## Course Overview

This course is about [[Sequential Decision Making|sequential decision making]], not just reinforcement learning or robotics. The name of the course comes from physiology, but we use it in a more general sense: given certain inputs from sensors (about the state of the environment), we want to produce outputs in our motors (actions in the environment).

First, start with this [[Learning Methods Overview|overview]] of learning methods in the class.
