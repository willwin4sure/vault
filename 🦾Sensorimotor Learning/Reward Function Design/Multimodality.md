Suppose you receive multiple ways of performing a task. You might end up averaging over them, but this could lead to a worse policy than any one demonstrator.

It turns out this is never an issue with discrete action spaces, only continuous ones.

The problem is that using, say, a basic Gaussian is not expressive enough, Use a mixture of Gaussians or a diffusion model instead. (look up Diffusion policies).
