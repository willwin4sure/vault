#MIT #CS 

From the MIT course [6.1100 Computer Language Engineering](https://student.mit.edu/catalog/search.cgi?search=6.1100) taught by Martin Rinard. The main reference for these notes is Engineering a Compiler by Keith D. Cooper and Linda Torczon.

A compiler translates a computer program from one language into a computer program in another language. Usually, it goes from a high-level language (like C++) into a lower-level language (like Assembly).

There are two fundamental principles of compilation:

> 1. The compiler must preserve the meaning of the input program.
> 2. The compiler must discernibly improve the input program.
