> If you can generate the entire project using O3 and it works, please do so. And you'll get your 75% of the grade.

> One of the worst things you can say while building compilers is "it's complicated but I'm smart". Because it's usually more complicated than you are smart.

> If you give me the code in a program but not its data structures, it is hard to understand. But give me the data structures and I can even infer what the code should do!

> All art is about one of three things: love, search of self, and revenge. You guys are the perfect age for the first two. Revenge, you're too young for that.

> Coming to MIT is all about learning to do hard things that other people cannot. Building a compiler is one of those hard things.

> LLMs produce superficially good code, but you need to learn how to fix their outputs. Much like graduate students.

> He was the type of person to organize all the books on his bookshelf in alphabetical order.

> If you don't know the difference between countable and uncountable infinities you are less intellectually mature than you should be.

> There are situations in life where you never want to think modularly. One of those situations is during negotiation. Another is computer security.

> When you're standing outside you could be hit by an asteroid. What does this tell you about the precarity of life? This tells you that being alive is dangerous. The best way to deal with the "what if I get hit by an asteroid" problem is to just not think about it.

> How sad will you be? Sad enough.

> Who here wants to have a good life? Everyone here would like to make decisions that let you have a good life. One of the best decisions for a good life is making a good data representation for your compiler.

> You have to know what's important about each slide. The important thing about this slide is that these types of problems are easy to manufacture for the exam.

> There is an optimal amount of novelty in any design.

> When you see something wrong in the world, what should you do? Fix it! Make the world a better place.

> Ha! Ha! Ha! You made a mistake, no graduation for you.

> You should go off and write your thesis on why you shouldn't use a parser generator to parse a complicated language.

> One year there was a real social contagion where half the class didn't make an IR for Phase 3. Then they got destroyed on the later phases.

> How many of you know someone who just gets lucky every time? Well, it turns out there's a way to get lucky. And that is constantly putting yourself in situations where you can get lucky. One group of people who are very good at this are venture capitalists.

> The worst kind of a startup is a startup of zombies. One that never really succeeds but also never really fails. And you waste the best years of your life on nothing.

> First thing, breathe. If you don't breathe, you die. Second thing, drink. Third thing: if you're tired, sleep. If you're hungry, eat. Try it for a semester and see what happens! You'll be surprised by the results. But turns out there's another thing you need to be a successful human. And that's hope.

> They say money can't buy happiness. That's been disproved by economists. But it's also been disproven by a poet: "whoever said money can't buy happiness simply don't know where to shop".

> Can money buy hope? What's the cheapest way to buy hope? A lottery ticket. Costs about the same as coffee. But you don't need coffee, and you need hope. So next time you want to buy a coffee maybe buy a lottery ticket instead... but then someone came in and told me that they spent all their money on lottery tickets and now there's no hope left!

> Treat your LLM like your roommate.

> Every PhD student will undergo a thesis-mania stage: you panic that your advisor is not going to sign off your thesis, and you go temporarily insane.

> What do you do with an animal that's misbehaving? You shoot it with a gun.

> People say that they want fame and fortune... forget it! When you're dead, you're gone and forgotten. So get what you want out of life and don't derive value from other people's validation.
