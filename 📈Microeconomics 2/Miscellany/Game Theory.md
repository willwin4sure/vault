Not much to see here either, go to the [[ðŸŽ®Game Theory Portal]] for details. Here is a new proof though.

> [!theorem]
> Every finite game has at least one (mixed) Nash equilibrium.

The proof uses [[Kakutani's fixed point theorem]]. Simply consider the "best response correspondence" that maps (mixed) strategy profiles to their best responses via $\text{BR}: S\to S$. Then, we just need to check some of the technical conditions to apply Kakutani's and show the existence of a fixed point under this correspondence, which must be a Nash.
