We've seen this in [[ðŸŽ®Game Theory/Strategic Analysis/Imperfect Competition|14.12]] already. There are two sources of imperfect competition:

1. Oligopoly: a small number of competing firms.
2. Product differentiation: goods are imperfect substitutes.

The new model we haven't talked about yet is the ==Stackelberg (sequential quantity) model==, where simply one firm picks their quantity before the other. This usually means the first firm will capture more of the market; they optimize under the assumption that the second firm will pick the best response.

Here are the orderings of these various models in terms of increasing prices, decreasing quantities, increasing firm profits, and decreasing social efficiency, for substitute products:

1. Bertrand (compete on prices).
2. Stackelberg (sequentially compete on quantity).
3. Cournot (compete on quantity).
4. Cartel (cooperation).

There's some more on adding fixed costs to the profit model; the moral of the story is that as fixed costs tend to $0$ and number of firms tends to $\infty$, the price approaches the competitive limit down from above.

You can also model collusion/cheating as an infinitely-repeated game, and entry deterrence and a dynamic game with a SPNE.
