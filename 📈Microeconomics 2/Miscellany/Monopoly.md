This occurs when a single firm is the only producer of a good.

## Barriers to Entry

Monopolies only exist when there are [[ðŸ“ˆMicroeconomics 1/Monopoly and Oligopoly/Monopoly#How do Monopolies Arise?|barriers to entry]]:

* Technical barriers to entry, e.g. special knowledge or unique resources.
* Legal barriers to entry, e.g. patents or government franchise.
* Endogenous barriers to entry, e.g. R&D, purchase of unique resources, or unfair competition.

## Uniform Price

You've heard this story in [[ðŸ“ˆMicroeconomics 1/Monopoly and Oligopoly/Monopoly|14.01]]: you produce $q$ to optimize $p(q)\cdot q-c(q)$. This results in a [[ðŸ“ˆMicroeconomics 1/Monopoly and Oligopoly/Monopoly#^ce9808|markup]] which is [[Profit Maximization#Non-competitive Case|related to the price elasticity of demand]], where inelastic demand leads to higher markup. This leads to [[Surpluses and Welfare Economics#^43802d|deadweight loss]].

## Price Discrimination

[[ðŸ“ˆMicroeconomics 1/Monopoly and Oligopoly/Monopoly#^189fad|Price discrimination]] is when a monopolist tries to sell goods for different prices to different customers. This recaptures surplus, but it all goes to the firm. It's also not very reasonable (e.g. must prevent reselling), though it could be possible in a coarser form.

* First degree: perfectly discriminate per consumer.
* Second degree: offer different tiered packages at different prices.
* Third degree: give different prices to different groups, e.g. students v.s. non-students, rural v.s. urban.
