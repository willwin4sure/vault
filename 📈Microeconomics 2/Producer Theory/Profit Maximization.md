Also discussed in 14.01: both the [[Firms in Competition|competitive case]] and the [[ðŸ“ˆMicroeconomics 1/Monopoly and Oligopoly/Monopoly|non-competitive case]].  

## Non-competitive Case

This is a [[ðŸ“ˆMicroeconomics 1/Monopoly and Oligopoly/Monopoly|monopoly]], where the quantity you decide to produce affects the price, a la inverse demand curve.

In summary, firms will equate marginal revenue to marginal cost:
$$
p+q \frac{dp}{dq}=C'(q).
$$
This results in lower quantity being produced than the competitive case since the second summand on the left is negative. The markup experienced is
$$
\frac{p-C'(q)}{p}=-\frac{1}{e_{q,p}},
$$
where $e_{q,p}$ is the elasticity of demand. Therefore, the more elastic the demand, the less markup there is (since there are alternatives).

## Competitive Case

Now you just set $p=C'(q)$ directly. In the short run it's also nice to separate costs into fixed costs and variable costs.

## Direct Profit Maximization

This is another approach where we directly write the problem as maximizing the function
$$
\pi(k,l)=pf(k,l)-wl-vk,
$$
where $f$ is the production function and $w,v$ are the wage and rental rates.
