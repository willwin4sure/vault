## Taxation

Suppose the first case generates a utility $u$ for the consumer, so $E(p_{x},p_{y},u)=I-T$; this makes $T$ for the government. For the second case to also generate utility $u$ for the customer, we require that $E(p_{x}+t,p_{y},u)=I$.

Consider the Taylor expansion of $E$ about the base point $(p_{x}+t,p_{y},u)$. We get that
$$
E(p_{x},p_{y},u)\approx E(p_{x}+t,p_{y},u)+(-t)\frac{ \partial E }{ \partial p_{x} } + \frac{1}{2}(-t)^{2}\frac{ \partial^{2}E }{ \partial p_{x}^{2} }.
$$
Recall from [[Hicksian Demand and Expenditures#^b2f21c|Shepherd's lemma]] that this is equal to
$$
I-T \approx I - tx^{c}+\frac{1}{2}t^{2}\frac{ \partial x^{c} }{ \partial p_{x} }.
$$
Now note that $tx^{c}$ is the revenue $R$ generated by the government in the second case. Therefore, $R$ is less than $T$ by about $\frac{1}{2}t\Delta x$, where $\Delta x=-t \frac{ \partial x^{c} }{ \partial p_{x} }$ accounts for the substitution away from the good.

> Lump-sum tax generates more revenue for the government for a fixed consumer utility, due to lack of substitution effect.

## Compensation for Price Changes

Suppose the price of a good $x$ rises from $p_{x}^{a}$ to $p_{x}^{b}$. The consumer is certainly worse off, but by how much, measured in terms of money? A naive measure would be the extra cost of buying the old consumption bundle, i.e. $(p_{x}^{b}-p_{x}^{a})x^{a}$.

Here is a picture of a Hicksian demand curve, where you purchase $x_{0}$ when the price is $p_{x}$ and $x_{t}$ if the price is $p_{x}+t$.

> The introduction of the ad valorem tax decreases the consumer surplus by the area of the trapezoidal region $ADEC$.

> [!definition] (Compensating variation)
> The ==compensating variation== of a price change is the change in expenditure if you tried to keep your original utility $u^{a}$:
> $$
> CV=E(p_{x}^{b},p_{y}^{a},u^{a})-E(p_{x}^{a},p_{y}^{a},u^{a}).
> $$
> This is the "amount of money you need to be *compensated* for the price change".

Note that
$$
E(p_{x}^{b},p_{y}^{a},u^{a}) - E(p_{x}^{a},p_{y}^{a},u^{a})=\int_{p_{x}^{a}}^{p_{x}^{b}} \frac{ \partial E(p_{x},p_{y}^{a},u^{a}) }{ \partial p_{x} }  \, dp_{x}=\int_{p_{x}^{a}}^{p_{x}^{b}}x^{c}(p_{x},p_{y}^{a},u^{a})  \, dp_{x}  
$$
by [[Hicksian Demand and Expenditures#^b2f21c|Shepherd's lemma]].

> [!definition] (Equivalent variation)
> The ==equivalent variation== of a price change is the change in expenditure if you accept the new utility $u^{b}$:
> $$
> EV=E(p_{x}^{b},p_{y}^{a},u^{b})-E(p_{x}^{a},p_{y}^{a},u^{b}).
> $$
> This is the "amount of money lost before the price change that would be *equivalent* to the price change". This is more clear if you replace the first term with $E(p_{x}^{a},p_{y}^{a},u^{a})$.

Since the price went up, the value of money in terms of goods is higher before the price change. Therefore, equivalent variation is at least compensating variation in this case.

The naive variation is sandwiched between them.

## Cost of Living Indices

Suppose the current prices are $(p_{x}^{a},p_{y}^{a})$, so you spend you income $I$ to purchase $(x^{a},y^{a})$, conferring a utility $u^{a}$.

Now the prices changed to $(p_{x}^{b},p_{y}^{b})$. We want a measure of how the cost of living has changed!

The "true" index is
$$
\frac{E(p_{x}^{b},p_{y}^{b},u^{a})}{p_{x}^{a}x^{a}+p_{y}^{a}y^{a}},
$$
i.e. the ratio of how much you need to spend now versus how much you had to spend before, in order to achieve the same utility.

However, the [[Economic Measurement#^2e5f38|"conventional" index]] is
$$
\frac{p_{x}^{b}x^{a}+p_{y}^{b}y^{a}}{p_{x}^{a}x^{a}+p_{y}^{a}y^{a}},
$$
where you measure new expenditure based on the old optimal bundle. This is all you can observe anyway.

Note that the true index is always upper bounded by the conventional index, since there might be a new optimal bundle on the $u^{a}$ isoutility curve with lower expenditure.
