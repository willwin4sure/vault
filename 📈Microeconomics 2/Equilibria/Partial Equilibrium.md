So far, we've modelled [[Marshallian Demand and Indirect Utility|demand]] via individual consumer decisions to maximize utility under budget constraints.

We've also modelled [[Production Functions|supply]] via individual firm decisions to maximize profit under production, labor, and capital constraints combined with market dynamics.

Under no externalities, just take their horizontal sums to get the full supply and demand curves. There are some effects on supply, e.g.

* In very short run, supply is vertical.
* In short run, the number of firms is fixed and they each have some sunk/variable cost.
* In long run, there are no sunk costs and firms have free entry/exit.

> [!definition] (Partial equilibrium)
> The ==partial equilibrium== for this market is where the supply and demand curves intersect, i.e. $D(p^{*})=S(p^{*})$. We call this "partial" since we're only analyzing one good at a time.

This competitive equilibrium maximizes total surplus.

## Tax Incidence

Let's look at one particular example where a tax $t$ per unit is imposed. Then, we need to solve
$$
D(p_{d})=S(p_{s})\quad \text{where}\quad p_{d}-p_{s}=t.
$$
You can go and solve this and then look at the welfare impacts.
