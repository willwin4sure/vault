Now we repurpose the [[Edgeworth Box|Edgeworth box]] picture for the case of a firm choosing how to balance production of two goods $X$ and $Y$ given fixed total labor and capital.

The picture is highly analogous:

This time, we have a production function for each of $X$ and $Y$, whose isoquants are drawn in red and green, respectively. Then, efficient production is achieved where these curves are tangent.

In the general case with more inputs and goods, you achieve efficiency when we equate the marginal rate of technical substitution across all pairs of inputs in the production of all goods.
