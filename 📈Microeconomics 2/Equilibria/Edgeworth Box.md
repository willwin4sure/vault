## Efficient Allocation

Consider the following image.

![[edgeworth_efficiency.png|center|512]]

The black dot represents the current state of affairs:

* Ann has 200 of good X and 5 of good Y.
* Bob has 100 of good X and 5 of good Y.

Meanwhile, the red curves are the isoutilities for Ann, and the green curves are the isoutilities for Bob.

> [!definition] (Efficient allocations)
> ==Efficient allocations== are points where *there is no trade that makes both parties strictly better off*.

Here's another picture:

> [!definition] (Pareto improving allocations)
> For a given allocation, allocations where both parties are strictly better off is called the space of ==Pareto improving allocations==.

> Pareto improving allocations are sandwiched between the two isoutilities passing through the current allocation.

And another picture:

![[edgeworth_contract_curve.png|center|512]]

> [!definition] (Contract curve)
> For a given allocation, the intersection of the efficient allocations and the Pareto improving allocations is called the ==contract curve==.

So Ann and Bob would be happy if we could just teleport them to a spot on the contract curve.

## Price Exchange

Now instead suppose that Alice and Bob need to exchange goods based on some agreed price ratio. If this ratio is off, there will be excess demand for a particular good:

![[edgeworth_excess_demand.png|center|512]]

For example, with the price ratio above, there is excess demand for the good X, and we are not at equilibrium. The following ratio does give a ==competitive equilibrium==, however:

![[edgeworth_competitive_equilibrium.png|center|512]]

> [!idea] (Competitive equilibria are stable)
> Note that market forces actually push us to the second picture: there is excess demand for X, so its price goes up, driving us *towards* the competitive equilibrium!

In general, efficiency requires that we equate the marginal rate of substitution between any two goods across any two customers, and competitive equilibrium ensures this.

Therefore, competitive equilibria are on the contract curve, and are efficient. We will also see this [[Consumption Equilibrium#^4373e7|in general]].
