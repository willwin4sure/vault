We now move to the theory of general equilibria.

Three historical solutions:

1. Tradition.
2. Central planning.
3. Markets.

We prefer to consider a model where everyone acts in their own best interests. Luckily, this sort of competition actually produces both a stable equilibrium *and* a socially good outcome! This is why markets are amazing!

Indeed, it turns out that:

> 1. There exists a set of prices such that markets for every good clear if each consumer/firm maximizes utility/profits taking prices as given.
> 2. The allocation corresponding to equilibrium prices is efficient.
> 3. Any efficient allocation can arise in competitive equilibrium.

We do rely on some key assumptions though:
