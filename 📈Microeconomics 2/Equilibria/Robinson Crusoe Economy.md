Here we begin to discuss the interactions between production and consumption.

Suppose Crusoe can use labor to produce coconuts via the production function $C=F(L)$. They also receive utility based on coconuts and leisure, resulting in the isoutility curves where $\mathcal{U}(C,L)$ is constant.

Suppose that the price of coconuts is $p$ and the wage of labor is $w$. This means that:

1. As a producer, the goal is to optimize profits $pC-wL$ under $C=F(L)$.
2. As a consumer, the goal is to optimize $\mathcal{U}(C,L)$ subject to a budget constraint on $pC-wL$.

So it turns out that he just chooses the same equilibrium regardless! 

In particular, note that the marginal rate of substitution must equal the marginal product of labor.
