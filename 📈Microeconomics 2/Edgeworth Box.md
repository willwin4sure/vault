## Efficient Allocation

![[edgeworth_efficiency.png|center|512]]

The black dot represents the current state of affairs:

* Ann has 200 of good X and 5 of good Y.
* Bob has 100 of good X and 5 of good Y.

Meanwhile, the red curves are the isoutilities for Ann, and the green curves are the isoutilities for Bob.

So Ann and Bob would be happy if we could just teleport them to a spot on the contract curve.

## Price Exchange

Another way of modeling is to suppose they agree on some price ratio for the goods and exchange by it. If this ratio is off, there will be excess demand for a particular good.

For example, with the price ratio above, there is excess demand for the good X, and we are not at equilibrium. The following ratio does give a ==competitive equilibrium==, however:

> Note that market forces actually push us to the second picture: there is excess demand for X, so its price goes up, driving us *towards* the competitive equilibrium!

In general, efficiency requires that we equate the marginal rate of substitution between any two goods across any two customers, and competitive equilibrium ensures this.

Therefore, competitive equilibria are on the contract curve, and are efficient. We will also see this [[Consumption Equilibrium#^4373e7|in general]].
