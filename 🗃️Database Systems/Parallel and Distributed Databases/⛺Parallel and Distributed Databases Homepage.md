We are interested in large scale query processing.

1. Parallel DBs: how to get multiple processors/machines to execute different parts of a SQL query.
2. Distributed DBs: what happens when these machines are physically disjoint or fail independently.

## Main Sequence

1. [[Parallelization of Databases]]
2. [[🗃️Database Systems/Parallel and Distributed Databases/Distributed Transactions]]

We will actually contrast distributed transactions against another model, eventual consistency.

3. [[Eventual Consistency and Amazon Dynamo]]
