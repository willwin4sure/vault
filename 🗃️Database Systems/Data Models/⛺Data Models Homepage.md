Choosing a data model is a fundamental first step to building a database management system. Let's start with a basic example of building a database for a Zoo. In this model, we will use tables to express all kinds of different relationships.

People have tried many different ways of expressing data, of course.

Now let's dive a bit more into database design. We'll also discuss normalization techniques to keep a database redundancy free; this is vital for transactional databases but less so for analytical ones.
