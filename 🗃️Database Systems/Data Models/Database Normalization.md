> Structuring a database to reduce data redundancy and improve data integrity.

Nowadays, redundancy is not necessarily a bad thing because of duplicated storage (storage is insanely cheap!). Rather, ==anomalies== may appear from bad updates (what if the database is accidentally left in an invalid state?).

## Boyce-Codd Normal Form

This removes all redundancy based on functional dependencies.

If you give me a schema $R$ and a set $F$ of functional dependencies, we can convert it into BCNF form with the following pseudocode:

```
D = {(R, F)}
while exists (schema, FD set) pair (S, F') in D not in BCNF:
	given X -> Y as a BCNF-violating dependency in F'
	replace (S, F') in D with
		S1 = (XY, F1) and
		S2 = ((S-Y) union X, F2)
	where F1 and F2 are the FDs in F' over XY and (S-Y) union X, resp.
```

Basically, you yank out the dependency $X\to Y$ into its own table, and remove anything in $Y$ from the existing table, and add in all of $X$.

## Third Normal Form

This is a weaker normalization form than [[Database Normalization#^00daa2|BCNF]]. ==Third normal form (3NF)== will eliminate as much redundancy as possible while preserving all dependences!
