A few remaining topics from the class that were hard to classify, and were only devoted a single lecture to. Not to say that they aren't important: **many of these topics are very cool!** I just couldn't find a good section to place them into.
## Main Sequence

Is efficiency all we should strive for? Just because there is no [[Surpluses and Welfare Economics#^43802d|deadweight loss]], does that mean we are happy with the societal outcome? Learn about tradeoffs between efficiency and equity, and how we even define a good societal outcome.

1. [[Efficiency and Equity]]

One of the two certain things in this world. Who really pays taxes, and how should we redistribute them? (Hint: it's not always who you think it is.)
   
2. [[Taxation and Redistribution]]

So far, we've modeled firms and individuals as self-interested. What if these interests don't quite align with those of society? For example, without governmental regulation, firms could dump carbon into the atmosphere at huge societal cost without bearing any of the consequences. How do we model and solve these issues?

3. [[Externalities]]

Humans are actually highly non-rational, which could lead to a breakdown of many of our models that assume optimality. Let's talk about some examples, and how we might be able to solve them.

4. [[Behavioral Economics]]

Our professor Jonathan Gruber was a key architect in Romneycare and Obamacare (the Affordable Care Act). Here are some notes on his final lecture.

5. [[Healthcare in America]]
