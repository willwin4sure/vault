> [!example] Example (eBay kidney auction)
> Auctions are great examples of perfectly competitive markets. Someone once offered one of their kidneys up for auction on eBay. Bidding started at $25,000, and the price climbed to $5 million before the auction was shut down, because it is illegal to sell bodily organs on the market.

> [!explanation]- Further Analysis
> **Positive question:** why did the price rise so high? Well, the supply of kidneys is very low, because of the very law making them illegal to sell. The demand of kidneys is also very high, since some people who are dying from kidney failure need them to live.
> 
> **Normative question:** why restrict this market? It benefits both rich people who need kidneys to live, and poor people who could use the money but can still live without one of their kidneys. Well, it comes down to two reasons:
> 
> 1. Market failures (crime, misinformation, etc.)
> 2. Equity (perhaps feels exploitative when rich people can buy their way out of problems and poor people are incentivized to sell their organs)
> 
> This motivates a key question in economics: how freely should an economy function? Capitalistic economies like the U.S. (individuals and firms decide what to produce and consume, subject to some regulations) tend to perform better than command economies like the Soviet Union (government makes all production and allocation decisions).

> At Starbucks, you can get a tall iced coffee for $4.55, or you can get twice as much coffee for only $0.90 more.

> [!example] Example (SNAP)
> The supplemental nutrition assistance program (SNAP) is a governmental program that provides a debit card to impoverished people that can only purchase food. Giving this instead of cash may reduce people's utility.

> By providing SNAP instead of cash, we have kinked the budged constraint, potentially leading to a decrease in utility for someone who does not want to purchase much food.

> Why do this? Well, suppose instead of **shelter** on the $y$-axis, I wrote **cocaine**. Society is a <span style="color:#0088ff">paternalistic</span>, and we'd rather our tax dollars not used to subsidize cocaine purchases.

> Should we actually do it? One way to evaluate would be to give a bunch of people cash, and some other people food, then see if people with cash behave badly. This is hard to do in the US, but the founders of J-PAL realized that it would be much easier in developing countries. Evidence finds very little cash is spent on drugs and alcohol... giving money, and something additional like business training, is optimal. 

>[!example] Example (Malthusian catastrophe)
>Demand for food grows exponentially with population. Yet production of food depends on two inputs: farm workers (which also grows) and land (which is ultimately fixed, even in the long run). Given diminishing marginal product form increasing labor, we'll eventually have mass starvation! What gives?

> [!explanation]- Further Analysis
> This was the argument of economist Thomas Malthus in 1798. However, he forgot to account for **productivity improvements**, i.e. the production function itself will become more efficient! Even if acreage of land is fixed, arability is not: better fertilizers, farm equipment, land management practices, and disease-resistant crops can all increase production of food. In fact, global production of food is actually rising per capita!

> One way to adjust for this is to add a technology factor $A(t)$ somewhere into your production function.
