So far, we've discussed how the market economy works to answer three basic questions: what goods to produce, how much to produce, and how to allocate the goods. To do, we developed a theory of [[Supply and Demand Curves|supply and demand]].

In this section, we begin discussing welfare economics, which is a measurement of economic outcomes on the well-being of society. How would we quantify such a thing?
## Surplus

Let's start with the consumers. We've already developed a way of measuring well-being: utility. We can even construct a more sophisticated [[Social Welfare Function|social welfare function]]. However, in practice, it is much easier to simply use money as the welfare measure.

How much well-being does a consumer get from a good? Well, we can measure it by their *willingness to pay* for the good; this is literally just the demand curve! If they are willing to pay $300 for tickets to a Taylor Swift concert, and they got them for only $250, then we can say that they had a net well-being gain of $50.

> What happens to consumer surplus when prices rise? What about if demand is more inelastic?

Analogously, for producers, if they receive a price higher than the amount they were willing to take to sell it, then they also get a net well-being gain of the difference.

## Social Welfare and Government Intervention

> [!definition] Definition (Social welfare)
> We define <span style="color:#0088ff">social welfare</span> as the sum of producer and consumer surplus.

> [!idea]
> The market equilibrium, where supply equals demand, maximizes welfare.

What if the government decided to intervene, and sets a price ceiling on a good that is below the competitive equilibrium?

Well, now the market is forced to trade a lower quantity since suppliers will not produce as much at the lower price. How does this affect welfare?

* Consumers go from $A+B$ to $A+C$, while producers go from $C+D+E$ to $E$. There is <span style="color:#0088ff">welfare transfer</span> of $C$ from the producers to the consumers. Maybe you like this.
* However, a total of $B+D$ is lost from the total social welfare. This is called <span style="color:#0088ff">deadweight loss</span>. ^43802d

Deadweight loss is a total waste from society's perspective! There are trades that *both parties are willing to make*: the firms are willing to sell the goods for less than the individuals are willing to buy them at, and yet, **they are prevented from happening**. ^5c3a1d

However, there is another cost to society: the cost of **determining allocation**. More people want the product than is being supplied, so there might be very long lines of people waiting, and it is unclear who should get the good. There is opportunity cost in having people wait around.
