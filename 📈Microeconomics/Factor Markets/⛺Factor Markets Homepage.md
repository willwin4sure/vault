Where do the wage $w$ and the rental rate $r$ come from in [[Production and Costs#^d16137|producer theory]]? Answering these questions leads to two new subfields of economics: labor economics (the study of labor markets) and finance (the study of capital markets).

As with all markets, there are two sides, supply and demand. This time, firms are on the demand side, requesting workers and investment; individuals are on the supply side by providing work. The two axes of these markets are the cost (e.g. wage) and amount (e.g. labor).
