We showed international trade produces efficiency gains from specialization. Now, we will show that international trade raises [[Surpluses and Welfare Economics|social welfare]].

## Impacts of Trade on Surplus

Here is the entire picture for imports:

![[imports.png|center|384]]

In an autarky, the US is subject to its own domestic supply and demand curves, giving an equilibrium at $A$. However, when exposed to international trade, we are given a *lower* world price $P_{W}<P_{A}$.

Domestic supply tanks, while domestic demand spikes. The difference is made up by imports. Producer surplus decreases, while consumer surplus increases more; the total welfare change is positive.

How about for exports?

Now the producers are happy, and make more! Consumers are sadder and buy less, however.

## Trade Policy

The reason people don't like imports is because it might hurt domestic producers too much! This is bad for jobs.

One idea for preventing this is a <span style="color:#0088ff">tariff</span>, which is a tax on imports. This increases the effective world price to $P_{T}>P_{W}$, as shown.

Consumers now lose out on the entire $A+B+C+D$, while producers only gain $A$. The government gains $C$ from the tariff (the width of the rectangle is remaining imports, the height is the tariff amount). $B+D$ is pure deadweight loss.

The government can try to offset the negative impact on consumers by giving the entire $C$ back to its citizens.

Why free trade?

1. Avoids <span style="color:#0088ff">trade wars!</span> Tariffs hurt the exporting country's producers. If we tariff a good that one country exports, they might tariff our own exports back, hurting domestic producers.
2. Makes both countries better off overall! Cooperation is good, and can help struggling countries.

Why not free trade?

1. Free trade is not good enough at *compensating losers*. There are clear losers in both cases (e.g. the domestic producers for imports), and there are no mechanisms for transferring the surplus appropriately. A small redistributive tax could help.
2. There are socially damaging routes to comparative advantage for other countries, e.g. China has low labor costs partly through exploiting its workers and imposing terrible environmental conditions.
3. Trade policy is a foreign policy tool. If you are angry with a country, you can restrict imports/exports! To do this well, you need to coordinate with other countries. Often times, this is not actually a viable strategy.

## Immigration

We've only discussed the flow of goods; we can also discuss the flow of workers, for [[Labor Markets]]! For example, an influx of foreign laborers could drive domestic wages down, angering people.
