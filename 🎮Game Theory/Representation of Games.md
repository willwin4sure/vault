## Payoffs

Every player also forms beliefs, likelihood assessments about the unknown. These beliefs leads to a probability distribution on the set of all outcomes $Z$; we refer to such distributions as a ==lottery==.

> [!definition] (Preferability)
> We say that a player ==strictly prefers== a lottery $p$ to a lottery $q$ if she always picks $p$ over $q$; and that she ==weakly prefers== a lottery $p$ to a lottery $q$ if she may choose $p$ when $q$ is also available.

> [!definition] (Utility functions)
> Every player is assumed to have a ==utility function== $u:Z\to \mathbb{R}$ with the condition that $U(p)\geq U(q)$ if and only if $p$ is weakly preferred to $q$, where $U(\bullet)$ is the expected utility under the specified lottery.

We are making the assumption that players are expected utility maximizers.

## Extensive-Form Representation

Contains all the information about the game explicitly using a *game tree* and *information sets*.
You've already seen this stuff from reading papers on CFR.

> [!definition] (Terminality)
> Nodes with no children are called ==terminal==, else ==non-terminal== (or, decision nodes).

> [!definition] (Extensive-form)
> An ==extensive-form== game consists of
> * A set of players $N$. Can include nature/chance, which have known probabilities.
> * A game tree with nodes $H$, also referred to as histories. 
> * An allocation of non-terminal nodes of the tree to the players. For each $h\in H\setminus Z$, $A(h)$ denotes the set of available actions to the assigned player.
> * An informational partition of the non-terminal nodes into ==information sets==, which are subsets of decision nodes that the player-to-move cannot distinguish between.
> * Payoffs $u_{i}:Z\to \mathbb{R}$ for each player $i$ at the terminal nodes.

The actual structure of the game is always assumed to be common knowledge, i.e. everyone knows it; everyone knows everyone knows it; everyone knows everyone knows everyone knots it; etc.

There are two pure Nashes, both of which are unfair (always pick A or always pick B). There is also a mixed Nash where you pick yourself with probability $\frac{2}{3}$, but this is deficient since there is a rather large chance of miscoordination.

> [!definition] (Strategies)
> A ==pure strategy== of a player is a complete contingent-plan that determines an action at every infoset. A ==strategy profile== is a set of strategies, one per player.

## Normal-Form Representation

> [!definition] (Normal-form)
> A ==normal-form== game is any list
> $$
> G=(N, S_{1},\dots, S_{n};u_{1},\dots,u_{n}),
> $$
> where $N=\{ 1,\dots,n \}$ is the set of players, and for each player $i\in N$, $S_{i}$ is the set of all strategies available to player $i$, and
> $$
> u_{i}: S_{1}\times \cdots \times S_{n} \to \mathbb{R}
> $$
> is player $i$'s utility function. We will often write $G=(N,S,u)$, where $S=S_{1}\times \cdots \times S_{n}$ and $u=(u_{1},\dots,u_{n})$, a mapping from $S$ to $\mathbb{R}^{n}$.

In a game with two players, you can express the game using two matrices:

> This is the common bimatrix representation you might be used to for various games:

> ![[battle_sexes_norm.png|center|256]]

> Here, Alice chooses between the rows and Bob chooses between the columns.

## Best Response and Mixed Strategies

Denote $s_{-i}$ as the strategy profile of all players other than player $i$. Player $i$ may also form a belief $\beta_{-i}$ (i.e. a probability distribution) about the other players' strategies $s_{-i}$. 

> [!definition] (Best response)
> For any player $i$, a strategy $s_{i}$ is said to be a ==best response== to $s_{-i}$ if
> $$
> u_{i}(s_{i}, s_{-i})\geq u_{i}(s_{i}', s_{-i})
> $$
> for all possible strategies $s_{i}' \in S_{i}$.
> 
> We also define $s_{i}$ to be a ==best response== to $\beta_{-i}$ if it is a strategy that maximizes expected payoff against $\beta_{-i}$.

Often, in order to stay adversarially optimal, you have to play a randomized strategy.

> [!definition] (Mixed strategy)
> A ==mixed strategy== is just a probability distribution over the so-called ==pure strategies== $s_{i}\in S_{i}$.

> [!claim]
> You only randomize if the expected utility of each strategy is the same.

We've seen this in [[Minimax Hypothesis Testing|inference]] and in poker: first maximize EV, and then randomize to remain unexploitable.
