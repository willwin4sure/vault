## You Know Things

Things that sound fine:

* You are smart, and she is too. (Ellipsis)
* You are smart, and she's smart too. (Contraction)

But this doesn't sound fine:

* You are smart and she's too.

As native English speakers, we all know this, despite never being explicitly taught it.

One idea is that there are priors (inductive biases) encoded in your brain already. This hypothesis is sometimes given the name ==universal grammar==. 

## Syntax

==Syntax== is the study of how words make up sentences. Here's two sentences:

* John walked up the stairs.
* Mary looked up the reference.

These have the same form from a syntactic perspective: the same parts of the speech are in the same order. Yet these sentences are clearly different.

In response to the former, you could say: "up the stairs?!" But you would be rather weird if you responded to the latter with "up the reference?!".

Here, "up the stairs" is a ==constituent== that you can manipulate, but you cannot do the same with "up the reference".

Here's two sentences:

* Who did the professor ask to see him?
* Why did the professor ask to see him?

In the first sentence, **him** can refer to **the professor**, but it definitely can't be so in the second sentence.

Here's some more:

* She thinks that Susan is smart.
* Susan thinks that she is smart.

In the first sentence, **she** cannot refer to **Susan**, but it definitely can in the second sentence. Maybe in the first sentence, using "Susan" explicitly implies that it refers to another person, rather than the "she" from before?

But this is a trap! What about these sentences?

* After Susan came to MIT, she was happy.
* After she came to MIT, Susan was happy.

How come in the second sentence, she can refer to Susan now?

## Phonology

==Phonology== is the study of speech sounds. e.g. dove is voiced while reef is voiceless.
