This is the underlying model for both labor and capital demand from firms.
## Labor Demand

Let's talk in terms of labor. The marginal cost of labor is the wage rate $w$. What about the marginal benefit of labor?

> [!definition] Definition (Marginal revenue product of labor)
> The <span style="color:#0088ff">marginal revenue product of labor</span> $MRP_{L}$ is the product of the marginal product of labor $MP_{L}$ and the marginal revenue $MR$.

This is just the chain rule:
$$
\underbrace{\frac{\Delta R}{\Delta L}}_{MRP_{L}}=\underbrace{\frac{\Delta R}{\Delta Q}}_{MR}\cdot\underbrace{\frac{\Delta Q}{\Delta L}}_{MP_{L}}.
$$
In a perfectly competitive market, we would have $MR=P$, meaning that we hire until the wage equals $P\cdot MP_{L}$, which is exactly what that worker would be producing.

Therefore, $w=P\cdot MP_{L}$ is exactly the labor demand. This is downwards sloping, due to [[Production and Costs#^78e50d|diminishing marginal product]]. 
## Capital Demand

Essentially the same.

> [!definition] Definition (Marginal revenue product of capital)
> The <span style="color:#0088ff">marginal revenue product of capital</span> $MRP_{K}$ is the product of the marginal product of capital $MP_{K}$ and the marginal revenue $MR$.

Capital is a bit harder to reason about, but you can think of it as the extra amount of stuff you'd be able to make by increasing the number of machines, holding workers constant.
