A market is a place where buyers and sellers come together to negotiate transactions. The interaction of the supply and demand in the market yields the price and quantity.

> [!definition] Definition (Supply curve)
> The <span style="color:#0088ff">quantity supplied</span> $Q_{s}(P)$ specifies the amount of quantity producers, in aggregate, are willing to supply, given a certain price.

> [!definition] Definition (Demand curve)
> The <span style="color:#0088ff">quantity demanded</span> $Q_{d}(P)$ specifies the amount of quantity consumers, in aggregate, are willing to pay for, given a certain price.

Generally, we plot these on the same graph, with axes $P$ and $Q$:

> [!idea]
> The supply curve is upwards-sloping, while the demand curve is downwards-sloping.

> [!explanation]-
> If the price is higher, then producers are more incentivized to make the good. For example, if a farmer sees that carrot prices are high, then she may want to grow carrots instead of potatoes that season. If carrot prices are sufficiently through the roof, everyone should drop what they are doing and start growing carrots.

> On the other hand, the higher the price, the less willing consumers are to pay for the good.

> In reality, these curves should be step functions: we could imagine there are some die-hard carrot fans which represent the top left side of the demand curve. Even if prices are sky-high, they are still willing to buy. As prices lower, however, more and more people are willing to buy carrots at the given price.

> Analogously, we could have some farmers with specialized greenhouses dedicated to carrots that are willing to produce even if prices are low, while others will only join in if the price rises.

## Market Equilibrium

> [!definition] Definition (Equilibrium)
> We call the point where $Q_{s}(P)=Q_{d}(P)$ the <span style="color:#0088ff">market equilibrium</span>. This is the point at which both producers and consumers are happy to engage in the market transaction.

> [!idea]
> Perfectly competitive open markets converge to the equilibrium price and quantity.

> [!explanation]-
> Suppose the price were lower than the equilibrium price. Then, there is excess quantity demanded compared to the quantity supplied, meaning that people will be willing to pay more to get the limited quantity. This drives prices back up.
> 
> Now, suppose the price were higher than the equilibrium price. Then, there is excess quantity supplied compared to the quantity demanded, meaning that suppliers are willing to sell off their goods more cheaply. This drives prices back down.

> [!question]
> Tell me what happens to the equilibrium when consumer demand for a good rises. What about when it is more expensive for producers to make a good? Illustrate your answers.
