You've seen [[Storage Allocation|garbage collected and manually managed]] programming languages. Rust takes a third approach: the compiler enforces a system of ownership. None of these features slow down the program at runtime.

Sounds a good amount like `unique_ptr`s in C++, or other RAII constructs for resource management.

To demonstrate the concepts of ownership, we will use the heap-allocated `String` data type.

## Rust Strings

String literals are convenient, but they are immutable and need to be known at compile-time. The `String` data type is heap-allocated, and can be mutated:

```rust
let mut s = String::from("hello");
s.push_str(", world!");
println!("{s}");
```

In Rust, instead of manually freeing memory (allocated for the string), whenever the *owner* of the memory goes out of scope, Rust calls a special `drop` function, where the author of `String` can place the code to return the memory.

## Moving Data

Here is some basic code:

```rust
let x = 5;
let y = x;
```

This binds the value `5` to both `x` and `y`. However, more complicated types behave differently.

```rust
let s1 = String::from("hello");
let s2 = s1;
```

`String` stores a data `ptr`, as well as its `len` and `capacity` on the stack (think `std::vector` in C++). Then, when we assign `s1` to `s2`, we are copying the stack data, not the heap data, so they both point to the same underlying data.

However, if both `s1` and `s2` point to the same underlying data, we will get a ==double free== error when they both fall out of scope. Rust handles this by considering `s1` as invalid after `let s2 = s1;`. We say that `s1` was ==moved== into `s2` (think `std::move` in C++).

Since only `s2` is valid, we don't face the same double free issue.

If you made `s1` mutable and assigned it to a new string, then Rust would also free the old string immediately since it falls out of scope:

```rust
let mut s = String::from("hello");
s = String::from("ahoy");
```

The original string will be `drop`ed at the second assignment.

## Cloning Data

If you *do* want to deeply copy the heap data of the `String`, we can use a common method called `clone`, e.g.

```rust
let s1 = String::from("hello");
let s2 = s1.clone();
```

## Copying Data

So why in our original code with integers did we not have to call `clone`, yet `x` is still valid and wasn't moved into `y`?

We are fine with this behavior because `x` is stack-allocated and copying it is inexpensive. The reason this happens is because Rust has a special annotation called the `Copy` [[Traits|trait]], which can be placed on a type to indicate that variables of that type do not move, but are rather trivially copied.

Note that a type cannot be annotated with `Copy` if the type, or any of its parts, has implemented the `Drop` [[Traits|trait]]. This is to prevent double freeing.

> [!example]
> Some types that implement `Copy` include: all [[Common Programming Concepts#Scalar Types|scalar types]] and [[Common Programming Concepts#Compound Types|tuples]] that only contain types that also implement `Copy`.

## Functions

When you pass a value into a function, it behaves similarly to assigning values to variables. It will move or copy, just like assignment.

```rust
fn main() {
	let s = String::from("hello");
	takes_ownership(s);

	let x = 5;
	makes_copy(x);
}  // here, x goes out of scope, then s. but s was moved so is invalid

fn takes_ownership(some_string: String) {
	println!("{some_string}");
}  // here, some_string goes out of scope and `drop` is called, freeing memory

fn makes_copy(some_integer: i32) {
	println!("{some_integer}");
}
```

Returning values also transfers ownership:

```rust
fn main() {
	let s1 = gives_ownership();
	let s2 = String::from("hello");
	let s3 = takes_and_gives_back(s2);
}

fn gives_ownership() -> String {
	let some_string = String::from("yours");
	some_string
}

fn takes_and_gives_back(a_string: String) -> String {
	a_string
}
```

Of course, all this ownership transfer is a bit tedious, even with tuples. Rust provides a feature for using a value without transferring ownership, which is the subject of the next section.
