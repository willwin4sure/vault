Rust comes with support for writing automated software tests.

A test is any Rust function marked with the `test` ==attribute==. An attribute is just some metadata about pieces of Rust code, e.g. the [[Structs and Methods#Derived Trait|derive]] attribute we saw earlier.

Here is the data automatically generated by `cargo new <project_name> --lib`:

```rust
pub fn add(left: usize, right: usize) -> usize {
    left + right
}

#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::*;

    #[test]
    fn it_works() {
        let result = add(2, 2);
        assert_eq!(result, 4);
    }
}
```

A new cargo command!

* `cargo test` runs the tests and prints the results with nice colors.

There are some more details here, about subselecting tests, etc. See the reference.
