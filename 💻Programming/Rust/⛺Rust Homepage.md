*From the [[ðŸ’»Programming Portal]].*

These notes are from my learning of the programming language [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), following ["The Book"](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/).

They are catered to me; therefore, I will skip things that seem obvious to me, such as elements that feature prominently in other languages. In particular, these notes may be useful for you if you already have experience in both [[â›ºC++ Homepage|C++]] and Typescript and want to see what Rust is all about.

First learn to setup the language.

1. [[Setup and Cargo]]

Learn some basic syntax that is common to other programming languages.

2. [[Common Programming Concepts]]

Learn about ownership, Rust's most unique feature. This is how Rust guarantees memory safety without garbage collection or requiring manual management. It behaves a lot like RAII.

3. [[Ownership]]
4. [[References and Borrowing]]
5. [[The Slice Type]]

Learn how to construct your own custom data types so that the compiler can help you guarantee type safety.

6. [[Structs and Methods]]
7. [[Enums]]
8. [[Control Flow by Matching]]

Learn about packages, crates, and modules.

9. [[Packages and Crates]]
10. [[Modules and Paths]]

Learn some useful data structures that come with Rust.

11. [[Common Collections]]

How to handle errors.

12. [[Error Handling]] 

Generic programming.

13. [[Generic Types]]

Traits encode behaviors.

14. [[Traits]]

Lifetimes specify scopes of references.

15. [[Lifetimes]]

Test-first programming, or whatever.

16. [[Automated Tests]]

Functional programming things.

17. [[Closures]]
18. [[Iterators]]

Heap-allocation, reference counting, and interior mutability.

19. [[Smart Pointers]]

Some more advanced topics: concurrency and OOP.

20. [[Fearless Concurrency]]
21. [[OOP in Rust]]

How patterns work in Rust.

22. [[Patterns and Matching]]

Finally, some advanced features:

23. [[Unsafe Rust]]
24. [[Advanced Traits]]
25. [[Advanced Types]]
26. [[Advanced Functions and Closures]]
27. [[Macros]]
