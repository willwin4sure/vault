*From the [[ðŸ’»Programming Portal]].*

These notes are from my learning of the programming language [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), following ["The Book"](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/).

They are catered to me; therefore, I will skip things that seem obvious to me, such as elements that feature prominently in other languages. In particular, these notes may be useful for you if you already have experience in both [[â›ºC++ Homepage|C++]] and Typescript and want to see what Rust is all about.
