If you want to actually learn C++, go to [Learn C++](https://www.learncpp.com/). The tutorials are excellent and in-depth, though they are a bit lacking in higher-level concepts such as threading.

The purpose of these notes is not to document my learning of C++ (*unlike* my [[â›ºRust Homepage|rust notes]]), but instead keep a recording of some of the finer points of how C++ works that I find myself constantly re-searching, as well as certain harder topics.

1. [[The `static` keyword]]
2. 

Then, some notes on harder C++ topics.

1. [[CRTP]]
