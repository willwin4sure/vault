> How to transfer ownership of data without needless copying.

Move semantics were introduced in C++11. They rely on the 

Flash example. const l-value reference to l-value reference to r-value references.

Uhh I also want to talk about singleton patterns and hpp vs cpp (surely you have to put the function in the cpp). Good time to talk about how compilation and linking work. and what the hell a translation unit is
